page
head kind it's not
or like sorry
how we need waste in terms of both
yeah yeah like sorry
now okay if that's comfortable yeah
how
yes slash probably try substrate actually i pull out a little different from each applicant yeah that's get okay
and back up and sounds while tam
whoo
the figments form posts
um
it's will
yeah s.
when the hard to drink coffee
and uh
um move
okay
okay
alright you could to kill
okay
oh backoff
oh
right so you just kiss to this powerpoint clockwork
yeah
how are point
very official yeah while
it's nice it's it's sh
h_m_m yeah
no
becoming less coming getting into it
out right um
so whole
just to take after meeting basically um so we're working now for real reaction this is of so
right
scum engendered to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting not um
the good in just do a quick opening the making of we all get acquainted with one another um the word start talk a little bit about tool training essentially that means getting used to
the only thing that we haven't tried out yet the whiteboard
um we've got a general plan for the project how are gonna go about accomplishing this and then just that a discussion close up
um
i_r oh
you guys sit up
gamer site um in real life um so it yeah
basically it
i'm like two and just go there you get of course you can discuss i'm thinking about um
ah proposing that
since we've got this would we are blatant uh of
or sell this and our roles
that we just don't have to don't tell
um so um if you say something about marketing right sorted um is gonna be easy to go from there be exactly the kind of um a meal of again if you guys it at the same time if you like logically something that's of economic
we're gonna sell remote control that's the sizeable paper book you know
you select well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because it backs obvious or go with it
i'm and we'll discuss it but
i'm not gonna ask do you know that
or at his into per right
in yeah yeah yeah exactly so
because we're wars sort of role playing see agree yeah you're gonna tap and your own knowledge as well
um sh that's the same for your when we do introductions i mean um
and you talk about your background you have fine you know make you my to um
uh
you know maybe it you're like an idiot like u. c. s. b. but you might say you want to hard or something like that one i you know you can
this is signal i guess you can have a little the phone itself
a guy's okay with that is that seem logical
how yeah spot
c_b action may switch
cool
so
i guess the to did
who were totally rich
we're making a remote control v_c is thrilling um
uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate money on and if you guys had time to check the inner life out of you guess it did checked the um
uh
the co corporate website um we've got
to make some thing is fashionable as possible that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and tried to
make it nice you know like john lewis nicer you know if you go to demo names or something
so um basically we are reinventing the wheel pot we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way
um
we're gonna go about doing that it basically it first we're gonna start on the basics and that's running need you guys user interface designer is an the um
um
the i_e
other designer that i can't remember league
the idea the u. i. d. right oh
yeah good
the industrial design and haiti
right on my getting into it
um
to guide me in guidance on this project \'cause you're gonna be your get you guys at the bottom you know you i cannot you can't do that you can't have you know x. and y. um at the same time
end then um
or work up from white is necessary to more like
what would be cool it
you know bike um
i think you have pad got the same the mouse i did but the idea of um
yes the coffee pie eyed needs to be able to hold coffee
yeah but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that if you touch eva here or something like that
um
it's a will work up from there and um then we landed talk at and then finally wap
incorporate as kind of the last taken away you guys build there are tell me it tell us what's possible and you tell
ass wipe weekend
um
hope for in what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer in that off obviously at the u. i. d. and the idea you know the you can keep on the recording at the cutting edge of how to get about maximizing what is possible
um to kind of sink at all up
so that's a detail the sites as a three state kind of thing
um
right so for now just for the would the whiteboard um
basically yeah i just the used do it i haven't tried it yet either
um i'm just gonna start here and um m_f_c_c to carry like five remotes around
um and
just write down i'm just gonna ride and one of the needs of my um
there's a disk enough to if you were trapped on it as a violent and you can only bring five c. d.s along with your name one of them that you could not all five if you wanna a five go for it but in one of them that you could
um uh i'll
we skipped interactions
nat s.
yeah i'm the pixel project manager
um
i'm mahdi
i don't know what you uni uh he easy santa barbara and then you're working on a p. h. d. in psychology
um
yeah
sort
um sarah i went to my she end and now i'm hitting cultural studies
and i'm marketing manager something marketing expert export templates of their planks per i think
i'm ron uh once upon a time studded in victoria
and i and um the
user interface design
and they fed on from
californian i_e doing uh
nice screen sub-shot thought
but you get you need and you set up a comment about augusta
okay
right so it doesn't amon guests
to look too if you write it down or you tell us well you know you are just gonna a couple of it
yeah the music anything as i'm sitting everybody likes meetings or some lesser or greater extent but option to some other options if your t_v
s_l_t like i am mikes model fairly they'll oh some of it is rubbish but i went to high school time willing actually
at up
the the make it the meg i laugh yeah
is your wayne or yeah
huh well
very my step
hell a soccer player but a total bastard modules really top like he's got six say he's a big guy
the
uh log a so
i really like yeah back way
guys in debug mode
who h_m_m
um
as though as like that remaining will have
um
and uh not um no other matters of rubber interested in there um
you get over operating and some become
okay so being really works just like a pen only makes noise of the thing
that's how we is interesting yeah yeah like present g_a_b_b_l
fifa and uh
you'll see
alright so um what was to get a mexican right dense intelligent watcher
what every wire
i guess elk and extension parameter
okay well pays all and light
one of the on yeah okay
basically isn't hand right
now with okay
volume much taller than me something in me
the l_m
i'll them
right now all i listening to the bile
there is an email or growl
press that gate um elision in
jose yeah nice um really lame
and uh huh
i now
i do me
probably class called the totally you okay yeah uh i mean
m_t
um
um and make it with a baby's well you had only to read that window of family guy is it is it did you watch the new season no one
are you get it online or is it gonna start on letting it yeah
ending the s.
how right
models of of they'll on the
h_m_m
oh all
in that moment train at our reader is upgradable
a for big work is to
yeah there are two reasons not dislike fruity numbers
oh for a point
uh and involved in your of the concert in belgium
the what i siding
suppose having it ten
um
thing i well above edinburgh
and i think in read those
in d_c_t
action in the sort of powerpoint
because i designed specifically to ignore idea here is to build just the five by five i can't read that much
uh is yes it okay to remove
pre valid
that's cool yeah uh excel horrible i've seen more you're in in this industry for for a previously
by this came from glasgow uh i'm
happy to say that there's no there's a salient con to be approximately
it's so whole meeting in
it really should discover at
does uh
written it
alright yeah
huh
hm many and nice
hair
i'm going to line in there you don't local hack to be here for three years some anything that the terminology right
i've already got more than i can keep track of um i'm gonna go home next weekend and make it on my guide you to close your home yet now they'll be like
see something british e. like i'll shut up in your normal uh it should be interesting
yeah i mean tight helen at coming back
here uh talent
three give see gonna stay here
probably ready skinner work reset for a while and then decide
it can really aged yeah indices are a blessing to yeah yeah
uh yeah i can think of some yellow one well yeah that's why is how we're yeah
something in this stuff now tell
i miss coffee freight in his body
uh uh cost less than a yet to be to maintain sorta like we're working from a government i'd rather send you did a lot yeah uh um
why uh he ever send a would be achieved
yeah how are really uh i lost lives in search just gaps
cal
well have one somehow formalists s. t. going to certain mike nor account sorry you
you just can't get a better riedel's or dealers in setting up
it's safer \'cause and send it go
it so it's his or her general
probably hopper and esteem
it must make all the difference yeah i will just not
at his
it this other things to this you just can't places like uh whatever the school and you can set of our descent on top
the message give you is okay
it's just i can um
like a yeah take to box like liberty to box
as my mass right i guess yeah
good call on uh
uh yeah
where you from send him yeah
um gee
just literally just metropolitan send a rather like five major zero okay so nevada actually
already yeah second cancelled on
thirty sec yeah death
i
close uh your client cough shop is by university yeah imports yeah yeah it's actually like literally happen often
that's cool uh agreeable small well
yeah as we're discussing the for
no more often saying
all
general or rio
right so okay success on the whiteboard you can harness the answer now a little bit infections we talked about some aurora c. d. isn't
things we like about the saying the whole thing go
um right so that we want to not fun stuff keller project finance
um basically what we're trying to do this cell is remote for twenty five euros
um
this is what the find us apartment is told me the c. f. o. but i don't know
i'm not sold on this is a pretty dire i'm even
twente if
that's like you know forty boxed for a remote you'll have to
pretty much like you might want reform it too i'm so what we can maybe work on that later but we're gonna make a one and the proper names to make fifty million euros on it in your international it so
uh um ooh
the one of things that i was gonna mentioned you do i guess the designers is that
um it and we probably need a river it needs to be a universal remote control probably okay um so something that could do in t. s. c. as well as pile as well as various other formats like it's gonna control the goodies but um you know only lets you guys but that's something that is gonna be international sold thing
um won't one try to make it for twelve fifty
so i would wanna try to make a hundred percent half an hour if we can't
um ps right so um just the close up i'm not sure how much time ideas that and extract right project manager
sorted
um
is i will mean another half an hour sell um
and i like the um industrial then get did think about what needs to be done like what the basic function of it
um
u. i. d.
well yeah you're right get your time is up there and you'll also get assignments from in your email as well more sparse specific somewhat to deal
um in base around so he need you to tell us what um
we what the user is gonna wind looking so
actually nor way you guys
could maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the users gonna wanna in what the user can half you know like um associate
yeah well it is a when we'll discuss the trade offs in between um and so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your e-mail
but i i think that that is more or less a good place to start from now um and he's more things come up will have a meeting in
the p. emails or so forth
um
any questions for we could side it
i assume there were building a stand alone uh remote control
we can't to kind of build that into other
uh product
each
you mean the langer and since like a mobile phone
for c.
i nine
h_m_m tsk that's interesting
yeah uh
i don't think there's any rules about it yet zeneca personal coach will
yeah
word works of you know say can we pretty can we sell of
remote control phone for twenty five pounds or pops
well have a think about it any o_c_r i'm i'm certainly open it seems like yeah it seems like it's certainly doable isn't it
i me in um
or if we can't have a for mobile phone me via remote that has some other kind of useful function
the clap and i mean pen but no good idea gonna go to see visually
every boat changeable faces like face they can buy for uh like uh i dunno like that hot
how huh
yeah uh
it's true i guess we would probably have some time maybe we should bring server below what we wanna do it
go back to uh am
oh really having the need bring up something about
our basic goals here what we want to
accomplish
uh project in outs but
okay
no related
nei yeah
no out so much
from
uh i i will find him or her own
now we also discussing can ever initial ideas and yeah yeah let's delayed still
say where it up an initial ideas
i know going take notes on this to his
get any
step two minute yeah handy element in
it's a initial ideas
didn't
the to pretty much again it's gonna be universe all
real mid side that are ready
and it need the function for other things as you said there's like all the other thing too keen remote still like your microwave or a front you are like
ten abner didn't but then
never been a fan those huge remotes that have like a million buttons you can't in within this mullahs data simple
oh think he specific
oh thinking
tide of p. d. eight uh
designed so type screen design
rather than one house so that you can depend of you sitting around all sorts of different things
yeah that's like is annette i mean my
step test yeah than the deserve yeah
so we got find it's more the chapter us perfect
um so with that this kind of an idea of a trade off between um
uh size in and functionality
oh yeah we also the month multi-functional but at the same time it against you too much you not leave all the tell them apart tenets him complicated yeah check out of the buttons
things
i was gonna know jeep
for feature reference this idea uh um
so you'd like um the blackened out like a touch screen type of remote them um
possible
i don't think well into this option eagerness needs one outstanding features set apart from what it has a rich yeah all the other universal remotes
um i don't know if there's such thing up there i guess we'll do so and do some research on or whatever screw some research on it about whether or not there are um ortiz format
like um
you know how in t. s. e. region one
where it
on
fruity sure there is
i mean i i have a friend or has a p. p. a. it okay that he display it
point set is tell any television he wants and all figure out there
the specifications of it d_m_t control it
interests also uh oh so i seem that that can be done with uh looking around the room
okay
um alright so
i like um like and then idea this idea a touch screen your remote with mulder format features um right
um
at sea
think making at a nice material would be very important because simeon this remote stacy is universal remotes like so cheap in low quality a nice and slick
would be important would
and it
i doubt note like
this such a problem with um losing them
fit adding this whole like p. d. a pen business is only one more thing the blues are gonna be careful what like
just something like keep in mine we start actually deal with this stuff
it would be fairly cool off
let's see
um
like the idea of the out multi plate
uh yeah he killed maybe holders fees please please
no name in the face plates and it's uh alike will have to company
yeah push has happened really was you want as well
whenever cooled user losers
huh yeah
huh um
that's part
i think it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have uh cut locator device
maybe it's a button that you have an intel machine topic finder measure
um i'm metaphor bundling it
in lesser sign their telly with the remote right
um
well if we bundle orders of phone than he can always call it
true if
you're not doing that then we can have something that just kinda rings frown either
well there you see below is whistling devices but that's a little monotonic
cool cohen only something more like just a little look like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote but you could place somewhere else that you press and it makes a remote page
kinda like i wanna what us um
uh cordless regular phones or yeah but page button nose break we do something like that it's cool i think so
i think we could design an yeah
care it
um done
yeah i think this material qualities well like i guess who what we can think about what kind of um
uh
you know the apples be really successful with the surgical why kind of distance obviously kinda no titanium the new silver sleek ones have less couple years yeah very much so curves
the yeah would you have the minimum i'm and i'm out i mean we're talking finances that are not selling out a forty pound remote whatever are forty dollar remote twenty five euro remote would be pretty
you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might want it trade offs some of the features for a lower price
without without
getting that whole like you know good on the bargain store remote you know bargain serena your remote that's black and you know massive some kind of analog balance there in some more definitely but um
have a think about what we can do have a think about what we what to do or how we're gonna sell it yeah regular users are mind like these
grammars are not gonna be a into this whole new let's design remotes they use the buttons so after careful for exactly working a stereo in who we're gonna be able to get out of
\'s true
we're talking twenty five pounds or twenty five euros twenty five euro she's
oh
slater
thirtieth
yeah
they're all we couldn't the roster oregon the dollar
not that up computer parts
oh if you can upgrade your computer bite in the states like um you guys are fries
each computer uh electronic store it
they serve um
are they say you as
they will sell things or precies
so you can buy stuff in america never shipped over flight twenty three pounds of uh
right so um
let's go ahead and wrap that a p_c here for now
i'm that are put these initial ideas that we've gone
he's in the um
project documents so if you guys spot near a reminder about the wide
we've talked about on the different you know kind of trade offs that we've got in the other ideas you can get software you'll be you sure
and uh right so thanks for that that's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about for uh
go he yet getting into
yet have an hour
um yes \'kay
u_m_t_s guys called
mike you're right
yeah aaron
i'll said
how set sign okay
cool oh right so um
basically i'm just gonna uh go over real quickly um some news i just got from the border how we're supposed to do with this um remote control and and or turnover you guys to make representations um on what you felt
and then we'll have uh oh did discussion
so basically i well i've just turn off the board and if he gets campus email as well but it needs to be television only
seven there were arguing d_v we're not doing anything else it's just gonna be television remote
um it also old needs to have the company colors included in it
um so as red and black and has to have a slogan it
\'cause guess forget the slogan it's we put fashion in electronics
um
in no teletext are much shorter teletext is but um assuming you guys it is so we don't wanna include that
um in this particular de site
for reasons a i i
don't really even now
this but it's deport so big out
so basically um
given those guidelines which will have some affect on how we design we'll discuss it later a meeting \'cause is television only we will be able to um change our uh
um
well we can sacrificed more function for a better television amount anyway so up larger over to the nostrils either i'd go ahead and make a presentation
so \'kay
so do i and wellcome anyway in
this play it here
yeah
messy a function i think that it was it is gonna come out
got we okay
right
as page fund
my presentation brain disease
fifa is powerpoint flatness
so if the um method we're gonna have to understand how remote controls working reset
processed like complete this project
um
remote control works as followers
small pretty basic stuff you lemons
uh um
sends message to another system
so
there's an energy source involved in the hot like a battery or solar power
something on those lines long
there's an integrated circuit p_s the microchip
uh nat actually compose the messages
and usually the way yeah a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system
hi user interface controls the chip
basically that's the case seeing in the buttons
and um decorum to mess just as well
so my findings um still uh preliminary steady here and uh i found that too much metal remote design could potentially cause interference
d. ability of the remote to send commands
in too much no can cause remotes behave unexpectedly very sitting paul signals
um are too much milos you sometimes people pick up radio signals and like
and there's also the possibility the remote cache and on fire injuring the customer
just think of those lost it already loaded that
therefore is jess primarily past of construction
um
components just some ideas that i had it um
energy source
it's kind of hit to be eco-friendly so i thought maybe we could do something must solar power
with her now klein battery backup
um user interface says this you can use metal i was thinking maybe a higher grade we cycle plastic can
but shape
um so i can bitch chip better wasting away around that we can't really be different not respect
um the sender well on thinking infrared \'cause it just the industry standard multi channel
or so we're ended up into
int
yeah uh power on n. t. s. c. compatible and dat
probably it's you under for range
uh and the receiver of course any number of like trying to voices
uh but in this case i'm a t_v use
um personal preferences
i really think that we sheet plastic as opposed to metal
come be simply count
ford
this kinds of loss it's which chip
and lily is gonna come at the cost of certain aesthetic value to were thinking
is it is her way that we can use um
modern the
perhaps of commas or model more types of pass except maybe do you have some kind of aesthetic value
um
like he the white like for talk about like
or on the left of these laptops another one a user are pretty nice
you can do is is a little nice color their quality plastic that we can work with
yeah there should be a problem
um
for example that task a avalon something is something that's
patch by pass performs today
syl sake my presentation thank you very much
um differ next we can have the um user interface developer go ahead and
take a brief presentation headed degrades well
oh that um
spot you soft and yeah well
i
for
oh
i for
well foul
h_m_m
um i
it function if it will quickly
hold down
hm
spine okay
sit plot them all
up yeah i guess
true just seeing it go sweep
from
oh
well \'ve so
here we have a uh my technical functions or design presentation
uh um us so
few the requirements we need here uh wing
s. a clean it up or no i tried device it needs to be universal
um and possibly uh operator several different types of races although we know uh find that yeah sorry i didn't get tickets e. is that's no problem
uh um
so uh work
so my findings um basically wanna send messages uh to a television scented
um my that would be any number of different things uh
such is switch on the television uh switch the next channel that sort of thing i think we're all quite uh
quite uh intelligent and no no wanted to normal remote control does
um
now
some of the other things i've found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see why read there very well that uh
this
my remote control has many functions
um so can do a lot of things but it uh is quite complicated and um most users will find it uh
find that they won't use most of the functions because he don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time
told her and how to do that
as you also nice is quite of pouring design
uh
another remote control
slave a different it's a simple remote control
uh
many last buttons but uh
how it's of
many fewer functions um h_m_m much easier for the user to manipulate and use
um
the also has it been about cheap l_d_c and it's also quite point
so my personal part that's there
i'm huh
revolutionize to the idea of uh our remote control
um so attain the functionality of the complicated device but use a simple format of display
uh for lisa together to work with
no he's gonna add another uh slide here but i did it
um okay just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously what like uh having multiple for display it's
what i'll
great thinks that run
hi
i mean i don't get that's you think sell
hey i can play yet to tell that would be perfect think yeah
spine channel
cord now give it a little bit
telling yet
okay act
so this is me um it
basically i was looking through seven marking reports we've got um we had a usability test where
we were actually serb light watching a hundred people
used t_v remote and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out question about what they like and what they do what about their general
t_v d_b remote control practices
um a it
pretty much through testing we are finding out that most of the time it
everybody's list using changing the channel turning out and using the volume
hm
the majority the time that all is going on the other functions happened for some people they're important but the primary uses are really really basic
um and so big complicated remotes like one miss on the last
presentation end are really
not the general public's use there're not using a lot of it they don't need it
they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons they don't what to do with
and um we also found out that a fifty percent more people there the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it and i can't find in the room
so i think that what we're talking about with uh pager or something will really come into play
with a lap these people off
um there's also uh sir write about what they like to that remotes and pretty much they all think they're hideous
and not very useful and it the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options
i don't know if that's already there look into technically that that's design people but it is something worth thinking about especially since the other demographic xavier c-one it's gonna keep going
sell if that's the jack sure hand and it's something to think about
um but basically it really is the primary functions and get and it's a look a nice which are
dist standards
sell
it's he could start for us
has great think is or
right then and so um yeah uh just uh
to switch that you link here
finish a pitch subpoenaed discussion help
plan on to my next phase
right so i think we've it cover most of these important questions through this um
three you guys are two presentations um
please died uh the the industrial designer is suggests there were pretty much uh emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic
um
sir uh
she's recommended that we go for a simple or functions so fewer functions um that we need to decide who we sell in this to use a years that suggested that
seventy five percent of people under thirty five one hinit and thought about voice control
um him so do we wanna go for that
or do we want to go for holder demographic in my thought is
um
we've guide
we're if we're gonna go for a sleek luck i mean we are putting the fashion in electronics and
um
when the media in tuner
pensioners of the world the s. c. sell so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic um
so
uh we need um wonder how about how we can make it
better and the smaller and faster um
it will constrain the plastics very well we've got this idea uh aurora saying we need to think about uh revolutionize in the way it's looking um which might be easier give their we're going for simple function in the ones on for tally
um so um
it's
hat would put this voice operation thing is i think a good idea um
assuming that it's do will what
um a lease for the basic controls maybe we can balance it that way you know we can see
okay you can't say what chord alias tonight and it said oh no we might be able to say um
volume up
gli
right
i think it be possible to you uh uh
combine the
locator device and the voice recognition technology them
then it would oh
um a could work
and like yeah
with the simple command mike
well okay tho
again then something really basic
i could start to p.
went
well he found his elegantly with into two hundred for range ten
oh yeah i think constraint key
the difficult see look would be in um i think
bike it
your kid and speak into the remote that you're trying to find
guinea have something that picks up
um of voice from far away skid point it's hidden under the couch
then again you have is we this we thing you know just a little chip or whatever the has a page but maybe that could be voice activated to
a little sticky pad to stick on top of your television news cecil into into that it yeah yeah
fines your
or an isolated magnet or something like that you know some of that would interfere i dunno the new technical thing but yeah like that i like that the voice recognition for the paging system
um
the thing is we might be old to handle the simplicity
of the remote control and kind of put the even more complicated things into voice control so could be sold to both the younger marking all the market and the younger market could use kind of the board voice control method
you know the ragged unit just an option exactly you might consider the older market could use this simple design with the traditional buttons and one
i'm just thinking something about the screen's army
oh or go ahead
the a uh
if we menu this touchpad screen thing and we still do we know if that's an option technically
this definitely an option to any of look into our hearts of uh touch-screen athletes and what not this year to be uh
you know almost his jeep is uh button method at this point
cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary stream just be easier no four five basic functions you have um menu options as i would have all these other complicated
voice recognition settings things that you're not in use every day in that a lot of people are can use but it is an option there for this high tech
market that sort of b. is this sleek thing more downpour
gotta wonder there for adding so much technologies this one remote or so gonna be able to meet or twelve hundred twelve fifty here uh
worth looking goal for sign these things in h_m_m it seems like
not kabila handle all those functions with just one mic ocean
my crush this point most expensive part of
turn it
the whole back in his of
yeah
cents just something to consider
ab so there
okay um well
yeah i guess will cast a bridge um
in a letter sil later stages of development um but yeah notes
perfect we've i will question
okay um so
i'm saying that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic in a minute there um but then in a sense it it's bells and whistles
are available for anybody who once um the basic rule maker sleek simple
m_m
functioned um
uh
remote control
um i think this voice recognition thing is output we've got a market for it um i don't
many won't be more likely core in the market on him as well we don't have many
uh mid
yeah
computed last one microphone it
will it
right now we don't have many people uh are these not very many competitors out there if they do that so cool
um
right
because you can't leave touched on most of this the idea of a paging function a touch-screen faceplates
um
the thing with icsi within a beer at we have maybe sacrifice the faceplates for type screen
um i'm not sure that since they're they correct i think you you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that
kind of has a portion of the device is not interchangeable where is the surrounding versions are interchangeable to the case in you'd have the casing be invisible
d_c_t okay
back to yeah they cost in material
we have to ask whether we're going to include certain m_b_as faceplates
with the package
as something out for say work looting
three four face basis contract the costs of blue and yellow questions if we don't put them out related position to evaluate
that market we have didn't need tests on
face plates and leather already
so you gather it there's even interest out there
okay
right top my head sense kind of like
a gimmick yeah wed
billy gail anyway
yeah cause i haven't you will have to haul itself like a cell phones like we have uh you know nope here model acts and then ten people make face plates for it read
yeah it just our model of uh a of to the remote control
one listing of a spider phone is in padded added around it is about emblematic arrest
you just sit home so what some the consumer watch t_v
yeah
well hopefully some people have people coming go we'll true yeah most people yeah the intelligence of a living here
uh i what we can we can discuss that one it further when we think about and um whether
the bla only
do costs in so for if um
true plastic is good cheap in a for making the whole thing out plastic anyway um
it's
yeah across type which later um they yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important
um i think we've madam better discussion already only seems a any other questions comments it came up in his presentations
what if we confirm that we're gonna go ahead with a a a touch screen
yeah you're okay tho
uh um
yeah i think they'll be best let's
based on which the well would you guys have all said to me let's go for it
it plastic
build per level plastic cased \'cause that that there is easy on the cast try to look for some kind of high quality or second pass against you recommended this great idea with a touch screen for the basic
functions
um
m. oh yeah but the the provisional let's go for a touch screen one with several sub menus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put that channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen
um
do we have
um maybe made it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people gonna have to recharge a remote controls
yep co at the same time
that might help for this whole com played of it being lost
c. would have a docking base
um
then again that cost as well out
um he were
so those new within the last twenty years have you in with the touch screen
yeah vet
okay went k_l_t flowing backwards implement this
yeah yeah and must be bind if we talkin to well i i don't think yeah i guess anybody lying l_l_p uh remote control that we have to plug in so we have to see some kind of new battery technology okay so let's go with a um
ted screw
way of um you know some kind of your with the with some cutting edge battery technology
three twelve euro those
yeah well it it's it's worth looking into if now we can always a faulty just doing uh well presented plastic simple does it you know it's we i mean you can put the big uh i don't know i mean suppose we could put the the basics on the center easiest you know you know people know the channel and volume function from large easy to get at and then the other the other bits and bob generic go through mania
um who do it via states okay so look for test gear the battery
focus is uh me
uh presentation you
um
it's sick uh with this voice recognition option as well
at um
just as for this simple functions see um
the all and off
channels
boiled grey
huh um
and uh um move
a small picking function even if you get the voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that just set i guess another infrared signal to the remote control and well sure emit some kind of paging just to be a
um right so any comets
outs before we break and do
go into the next round of individual work honors
since we're doing uh touch screen do wanna look into the possibility of people be else uh
input different types of skins for the \'kay yeah the actual interface part of it
things like that or is just gonna gate
one touch screen for it broke
interesting yeah
white what would be on a touch-screen \'cause he said earlier that we have to
take about company colors hand um
i logo to something about it i can't boxing illicit
we put it back she knew elektra yeah
whoa
it's my understanding that if you are gonna do is skin you'd need to have some way for people to
della import see is in the remote controls and cord then yeah
i think perhaps it's too much you good idea by yeah i think that that one might might just be um
and just yeah i think that we might just be out of the range for the springing about it
at p. d. a. would that makes a lot of sense for p. d. n. a.
\'cause you're gonna be using it yeah
connect up things any right uh
i know we guess think
think we should encompass a nice black you know a nice interface touch screen
yeah yeah oh i'm i'm in agreement with the and wondering how are gonna get uh
we put fashion into electronic delivery can use a touch-screen words gonna come on the like on your cell phone and i'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like walter loading and then he goes away
perhaps he can be like it temporary
hm
comes on every time you turn out of the mess it because it is a bit much to have it like engraved of presents rated
yeah i'm hoping first syllable or not maybe have a millisecond there's a tradition sleep yeah
yeah i know i d. it seems like it would suffice or just have the are on there
usually think ban it but apparently not
because so on their remote to be happy
see
flashing things accomplished want to it
b. l.
i d. to get
it it uh
well up fair enough um
and yeah that will help the battery life to it if the remote did you have to press about it for the remote to turn on
that again who wants a turn on a remote control
well you have to do is touch screen uh right now to wake up okay i'll go toward that goes on the sleep mode
a jet
i yell like that i like the idea of um
but in the logo in the blue up screen nice
um
um cool so a last things before break of
alright fair enough
put
were sounds good
and i saved a copy of this \'cause scusi remote as the save a copy of this and the mean cell do a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference
for my files in the shared folder isn't really it in it
that's fab guys cool
correctional
\'s
oh gee
opal
think ticket
um be loosened
requirement per cell
it is great to use um
i can't control alright
mean just
power point this uh
who will
huh so
hope
right so one um
this meeting will be about the conceptual design don't have space precisely what conceptual design is it just something important that we
dear
um
because it's kind of uh training the abstract into slightly more concrete and this meeting i peeled it will come distant
final decisions on what we're gonna differ the prototype
um it
right so um to
apologies for last meeting was brought to my attention that i did not make the rules clear enough um so i well time to do so more accurately in this particular meeting
good um
there enough thanks for the input ties good
um
yeah so basically our gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time um in gonna go through
i'll their remotes go versus
time by me a um e_m_l
call a what we know all about um
all we discuss and last meeting possible directions
and then we'll make some more decisions high and um
basic pop firm up our idea on
how we what this remote control to look
and worked
so
purse it
so we'll have to further it deal
is
where what sort of first is treated
i'll go first and i and you can
figure way
i
it is neither am i calling the wrong handle then it has been thinking good southern it or not
put to spent two
yeah okay effort
mister curtis been to that it's place
yeah okay yes
uh even
basically we're gonna have talked-about today it is um component design
antek
spend price-wise tension that we made is somewhat limited as we can do it because of where our manufacturer offers say we
basically what i'm getting in the doing it
t. about that
um components however remote control okay rewarding kind about this but we have to get into it
what do tell i'm probably have to reach some conclusion sometime soon
energy source um ah manufacture offers a variety of energy sources
you stan or battery
saw cells
i manufactured in say anything about with the end so we might have to like if we do go that route we might have to look elsewhere
um and also there's act kinetic energy possibility it
basically it's like kay um
idiap moving the remote which crater of energy to keep it
running so that's one possibly guy don't know whether that would be
powerful enough to eliminate a it
touch lee
no if
um so hopped look into that
uh um
the case we have a fee options
plastic
rubber or word it
uh i'm
and then as far as the weights shaped we can do
standard one flat which would pop it up
tina
curved or a ferry sexy double curved
i'll kind of fitness are we looking at
um
i nash and that we could specify um
i don't see a reason to go outside infect convention of
three or four dollar my numbers
okay
than in it
uh um
the buttons
there are multiple scroll buttons hubble for manufacture plaid
what to use there's you would have to use more chips
and now the cost as well
end if we to go with rubber double curved case
um what hot to use rubber push-buttons
\'cause the other buttons aren't compatible
h_m_ms with that
uh
and just so no they're tub screening calls
nei chip switch equals
my knee here uh
okay
days
um
one thing that and iris is that
most remotes operate on a infrared on the infrared part of spectrum so you notice when you push a button about one can see it
anything coming out that but in fact there is light coming out of remote end
at the television can backpack and if you what's record of your make appear according to actually see a light
uh oh one thing that i thought might be interesting ways to use
part user visible light commanded not just kind of does have fun get make
as you can actually see something coming out remotely push it question happy apart inspection that when it
damage to human on h_m_m uh
she cult
it is an absolutely could have that offer on suppress could select like
she yeah
i ensure that we could do that
um
the others idiots good idea yeah just as a fun
g_e neck uh
just says paola bit
um
then on to the circuit board that we're gonna years all synonyms the chip
uh we we don't have any and play around d. t. eight one one eight three five
um findings okay we have very limited by where c_r_a many factors can offer
um
in my question tall b. u. is
sure we look to other many factories must make do with what we have available
interest requests that a challenge mission
like say shop around that with their time constraints is that really a feasible option it yeah
right that's my can certain too
um if we do go to the within battery ruud then we'll have to go outside
error
my personal preferences option still like cards on the table
uh i think
wish by go the solar battery group
just kind of keep with the environments all a yeah
friendly theme that we have going on
uh i like did you the visible light signaling something test sets apart
and uh uh us thinking about
i was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in of writing a different case materials to see different
tay ace
sir not
so confine byte one
style and say some you know say our
the one if we just go if one is inc over while then
where in the bad situation you need
very
kill you marketing piloting too
try it to see what kind of fourier lunch clearly
so i'm now the received
it and option ever actually there's i've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now
which actually my didn't come in play
before hand
okay n_h_l's decide for now
making very much and then it's perfect so i guess i make sense reading
yeah i'm i guess l.
but because i found to my interesting things
okay
thank you
then fasten dishing out yeah what it to you in it
um huh right
so
chi like market trends
screen
um i the bayes has looking at what's going on the remote control market right now
and what's going on and other design fields or cease or what's what's trendy what's new what's happening
um not control right now basically everybody says they want new were fancier more exciting or second isn't boring
normal functional um that would we need innovative design options and then needs to be an easy user interface
um
the challenge is that current trends right now across the board in fashioning furniture in technology is it a very organic fruit and vegetable okay i think i am not saying we should have you know to made of shaped remote controls or anything but
i think it is possible maybe d. u. is um natural colors like if it is an option that whole organic sleek clean it
mine thing it maybe some we can look into different skin options of or if we can't afford this touch play thing ever touch
face screen
interface um maybe having it uh images it be it specific like you could choose your menu bullets to be
it's my device sheet
yeah they had sort of not being saved by the chip is that you know what i mean to sort of
and apparently the feel of the next couple years is spongy i not something i i like element death is found that if we can get around to getting piling i thought maybe i casing option like at
not like us scheme but like at holder almost if you could do like um leather options or what options or something i should have mentioned this um
as far as the rubber that we can use um we can user rubber
as per the case or has a consistency those stress balls he anything
might be announced to either go select
um
yeah so something to sit down for now so overall i think we should stick with what we're finding every is looking for easy you is technologically innovative end this fancy new with
i think perhaps the double curve thing in maybe there's rubber option is our best way to go for a doubt
um
interface o_o the interface graphics for yeah
um
well i've but then if the touch-screen thing is you work out for us that's really non issue
i like a to have rubber itchy because it's
ten set
my sister being durable or something that you can drop it doesn't matter \'cause so many you go to somebody houses hysteria some superb
of controls very true
yeah it with duct yeah very much that would have the phones you didn't we could have in duct tape
case it
a hollow
okay it i think that goes against the whole fancy something new mine them by now
michelle going with the kernel like uh at
a oh yeah
yeah maybe if
um
yeah f. that's what i know
great picture that's f.
he'll pile
brown yeah
all yeah
computer is it jast
one moment put this
so into rate interface concept
by your fits for user interface design it so you never user pays guys is basically aspects of a computer system
that
we can see
were here
or other widens uh
per see if
uh commands or mechanism is that basically user uses to control the operating and operating system
he's in in this series of different remote controls that are out on the market today
the think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look
yeah uh
um oh
so
the following are a bunch of different uh it into piss uh
concept
uh voice recognition we have we um actually have some and new
uh information from where
research design team bucked uh get to that in a moment
um so kerr voice recognition strides up to about eighty speech samples
um and basically record your on verbal labels can and connection into the remote control
now our design team research team has been l. two
uh us set up a system and which
uh you can teach the written remote control whisk recognition system
to respond she you um
with standard responses like
you could say could more ink
i uh remote control normal say sexy female voice good morning jitter
um off
that that
and in fact it we already have this for a coffee maker aligned
well single people on the uh uh another group on the remote control message payload
uh-huh um have for
another concept is what uh apple has come out with the spinning wheel with uh l. c. displaying like on the uh ipods which i'm sure most of you know um
um the pink
then we have the scroll button with the particular push-button h_m_m like a modern mouse a bit bulky a bit crazy
don't think that's what we're necessarily going to point
and uh some special components uh
ideas like uh blocking having the ability to block channels from year for your children
um
and uh dedicated buttons for
for commonly used uh a channels
and even uh ideas like secure hidden programming but uh and and again if we go affect screen i don't think that's a big issue
um
and uh this is kind at the uh
the big bad ear about uh uh uh at
uh the jumble universal remote control is almost impossible there misplaced easier yeah to see them
uh
again probably not what we're going for us so i i mean my ideas here and kind of where i think we're heading is something slightly larger the regular ipod
uh without her clark uh plastic casing although i think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely um very good ideas
uh change or casings and had
our design team was possibly talking about including one for extra faceplate with the package she kind of
set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing you kinda get used to it
thinking about maybe buying another one w_a_c and
add value to our uh
bottom mine
uh touch screen much brave
um possibly having go to buttons being a uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen
uh the important ones like power volume can job between channels
um oh and of course her voice command system which are talked a little bit about already
and uh the use of recognizable colors and shave state recognition of the features uh
that are around to sit of
read for power
um you air holes for
different
volume up some down some channels up some downs it might not
and up perhaps you and adding in some
stupid little or jokes with the voice recognition idea like
pre
for instance might toast you make it and i got from my bank
has jokes one it's ready
he
no ace
great and uh uh
that is about a hint
mainly for run
holt
he
might have good idea has
good faxed or have
i okay
oh
a to the needs a couple don logistics up this for it is enough to stand up and be done
uh it com
or kick them
right so
it and all that stuff i c_c as um
no kinda of to come to some decisions um
i think we can just go to line all three of those clever chat though
uh only
based on why out
needing presented is far as the um
is
their e. is
heart sing benefits
um
i think i don't know what he gasic about the touch screen this point
i think it's almost market will feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up another places
ken
uh ken me it
really afford it cause it looks like the b. that would be are really in maine
cost
source that and right
my s. and that is that there is to incorporate time screen technologies gonna courses upwards of
seven teen and fifty
year out
to present the moment yeah that's just nested yes
well you guys are always the damper is on its then okay you industrial designer mine yeah
it's um do and our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty
uh i mean i thought there was some flexibility with at
okay
there is it's just it is nationally justify and how much you know it does any we're gonna have to increase the price to make money
um from twelve fifty if we do want to get uh fifty uh a hundred percent profit margin
um that would mean selling it for twenty five she most place seventeen fifty back to you that's thirty five
whining
so
where you guys come up with these numbers
ach stuff atop my head
it is pending for their emails
yeah but yeah from them already brain um
well
the like think that's why people would pay for and if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote you can expect to do something
that's true i'd isn't it would be in a class of the term
yeah
and that's to be fair the um
the percent of the market we're not going for mass sine in a manner sales anyway we're going to make
i mean more when i'm talking about selling easily and of these things we just couldn't nova twenty five euros so
we could probably maybe shrink the profit margin the rather sell it for twenty five sell for thirty but that's something we can find had still with new um
i say that we
provision would go with the test greater
where worry well-wishers down matter run
i'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and i also think that we can probably come up with some sort of n. shiva uh
i mean stick to go about this kind of production light corners my team in the uh on the third floor suggested to them
oh we can look in this other manufacturing option you wouldn't get him somewhere else cheaper um
\'s true
but we could no
initially go with well we have
and maybe we can find she starting point anyway sound
and we can have this very simple type screen you know as i was cafeterias it's gonna be about the size of the ipod or whatever
yeah well yeah but i guess we can play around the feel of it i let's say that okay so that have screen will be our
um
i'm main selling point here
i mean i think that we really have two main selling point is a close race engine and the voice recognition really she's in pretty
bells and whistles color lower yeah little voice rec thing i mean
if if we're looking end
bottom will uh in
now we're looking it up in the casa seven team to get touch screen i think we might have to drop
voice right i think we have to decide between it would definitely yeah to be asked we have the cable we have the design in house i mean we've we've come up with is
what is new works we're using in for a coffee machines already
i can passe on an email from my uh at guy and uh
guy down the hall
sounds gain
curve room
what anything on it for about the voice rack
i think if we easy
we do both the obvious impression cost fun to go we help
bite
does pride interior
he become the rolls royce of remote controls but square
pretty well age
paris nice
i mean we we have period reflect back on what our market research it's m. a. and they said they wanted voice recognition
course maybe be hadn't thought of that school touch screen option but
definitely we know what the market is there for works recognition so to say we have a technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell
is a call i don't think i can give rise up so like really i k. cohen and say no we're gonna stick know everything we know
yeah
does having po through really upper class
i guess e_h out when i mean
there's you will after is um you can have it fast you can have a cheap you can have it
quality
pick two of three
you know you can't you can't have off flair
\'cause you but he's having number of chip so you need to deal with each
the fin function
well if we're gonna people to that alright so we have pick between one of material
um
wall
otherwise yeah we just it just becomes cost prohibitive quite which which do we suspect
we should a whole lot we should hold on to
well we are ready have research backing voice recognition
and it's you know
fiscally cell point
well per by that
i'd i'd
i personally would tend to in either direction but if that's what's gonna sell i think that's a we need to go with the new we can table this touch screen
for our next not all
i would have to side with that i think through
the voice recognition us simple we already have the
all the technology analysis ready the guidance package cheats
what is the cost look like one is cheaper to do the v. r. to do the uh touch screen
neck thing
well all my pre
it's um
it's just soft top my head
keep mine
bite
i think
their voice recognition we'd
they're both it
um
they're both going to
push the com sub
bite um
so is we already have the technology and has for the voice recognition
rug and had to do is much
design work into pans design work it's way pushed herself
right
pin and any
yeah point after you uh class and we're still that that we have to do with this battery issue nearly as much either um we can stick with what we've already got
nor lot other ways to
\'kay so i'm getting
alright so it more or less you guys think that that other till than the voice recognition will be better
i think it's a lower risk option would yeah right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all and all our best option
okay sort i_p
we will omit the ten screen in favor of voice recognition
it's you and me on set local
now so and will when are we gonna have basic
prototypes coming up next that's you guys next tap right yeah well we're segal sort out what it what in
what else we're gonna talk about one hundred temper yeah that's the next step to updated about how we're going to talk now about um the materials arrangements can is would just run through it yeah okay yeah um
you discuss it either a the feel mores solar power with the solar power be enough to
few ole voice recognition of this killer static one it would that be enough to feel a voice recognition remote animal
p. solar powered definitely would be byte
i think
just keep people from getting annoyed kiss sometime solar power fellas just another round that we should
install a small backup battery
hm
yeah
just a coming there's moments when
for whatever reason the remote hasn't lock supposed to t_v no basement
h_m_m like where if
yeah when we can't guarantee summit everywhere so having it show the resources probably yeah it works not the same as the solar power
calculator in you know how those does not really require that much why
churn
um obviously a little more light been calculator but we're not talking about
a white light does have to be
out
taking the some path yeah
three i'm stating
oh contact
very thing crown
i'm more in do agree with everything that's been said
uh i have to it's say though that um
and other ideas come up my if we're really not uh handling the
remote control to a great extent
we could possibly get away from a idea of having a hand-held remote control
and maybe kind of have
or round to
remote control the kinda was like paper weight or something like that
kind of us we would all uh need thing that sits on your table or something
co interesting
no matter the thought why movie away from handheld why
let's too
well if you don't need to pick it up
it could kinda you scout voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job
t. think people there
people are byron meyer they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition such or something
it is sometimes be true and ne
problem but i think we're being and selling it to more than jast
voice recognition people like we want it to work and fundamentally without the is limited to as well right
but that's done that's though bother mean if you look at the catalog from
places i'm a sharper image or whenever you know they might have or like um
but as it apple makes the is really
pretentious speakers whether the sub woofers and like clear in class and you know when we got a little true middle type of um splinters i mean why not have a little more rounded kind of thing it could still have the basic buttons on it
um
\'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well out
with the by you or
and maybe a menu button so forth you know um user channel button to scroll through the menu if they want to record programs or whatever you know because i think it on something p. d. s.
we need to escape the i_d traditional or shape of
remote
maybe something that looks nice on the tables would be guide even though and hand held the same time
think it's all bode
falling apples league
o. one b. i'm thinking of the airport movable you know like that little
pot little table extract
yeah i mean unless although we do um oh as i recall english you mentioned we need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminum thing and get back to her but he can have a very tasteful um
more and colored or rather told i have um
tarik condor bowl or something
still i mean yeah i've along those lines yeah i like that or like that ideal life um
but see we can deal as far as echoes okay and the other material like the plastics and so forth we were discussing that being i usually make a rubber kind of
softer feel um uh you know i work for further input tip on this pad is a bit
gives just at the at
yeah you know something where
it's uh uh more tears from of plastic what has some kind of uh
tacked out response to it
right
just kind of this squishy feel
yeah
which is the next big things sellouts
point or anything it okay
hm
yeah it's if he can do it squishy no and remote control looking remote control but to be very i mean just to be just put it literally put it on the
the night the coffee table next to the telly insane by um uh oh
losing any
no i get a like idea that's good
uh where we sort of discussed costs
um
i guess what that's gonna be uh i think if we were a bit over budget there might be okay go
sorry about the uh lack information com searches haven't been provided that finish by manufacturers
well i wanna sound into the data set
no more than one more but i do back
um i
no we just yeah com from there
um
so we've revisited the touch screen in more or less will that out um i think so worked more or less can we what we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um
s. simple kind of function it
you know own out
chew complex right
well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on the daily basis
although what i'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions they should be secondary
at least if no out functionally than visually like those shouldn't be
right
like many ending you residents
if yeah if we're not going to touch screen route then we can um
just \'s incorporate maybe
something that folds out like while you often see on these kinds remotes is the most basic functions up here in something that slides down tick
the element at the more compaq
interest
yeah well do wanna consider like an ipod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options
int
in them or in a cost issue natural we also have them them at the thing over for gonna have a normal remote looking remote
true how do we
yeah
fared of
but no i mean we could use slider compartment you know like if it's a it's a little vaguely ovoid type staying and easy to have uh compartment in there or you know about but a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then assigns up and down type thing like on huh
legality need player
yeah you demand immediate players we just have
um
a menu button on the side and then get stalls levels around the meanings kind of
yeah newman through me like that
so we got it are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons for point to use are going to use scroll buttons
rubber buttons
co what seems like
there it seems to me that we can just do the aren't
sick with the rubber
\'cause is for probably gonna be using some kind of
uh move
rubber for the outside case and others have stick with that yeah right
thing to certain extent we have to stick with the un
kinda but as a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then
and then make a unique feature casing had more time to and her voice command
well those basic just like for directions that are they can use as a menu or channel and volume are probably won't do it are really verse at all and
every is already got them to some extent um remote thirty own so it's not like we're dealing with every re learning things \'cause
that's that so many place to one of ninety four
right
okay
um
we vary kind of cover this is well
seems to be selling um number of more or less clear that we want to car
target the scene youth market
who
uh um
specially no with
i_c_s_i the thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population particular in technological field so um
hm to jack or had it okay
um
yeah alright well most covered what we need cover thing found in the in the final thoughts before we think about dinner we parted i'm not a prototype
well what do we actually do ache
low right i was just gonna step on to um
uh fo
oh i wasn't in a way that i wasn't though my better
um
sorry
yeah with all your uh
p. um yeah okay i was gonna assign tasks in the next scene of it if any any other final thoughts before we go ahead and
cool
so have we side that we are gonna go with
different style cases for different people
well we just going to go with wanting
it's very it's very impart thing to predict because
yeah you have different cases that might open to mark a little bit obviously
he have
just one case sin it doesn't go over well
yeah it's a stretch body say having marcus also cost policy
well then again colors wouldn't be so hard to do or you can uh i was there
i you know i have a kind of an actual what color like a staying in uh in the it
i don't hell
all in green or something it telling you so much of a problem to incorporate into the color of the rubber out thing
and again copying i max kind of for i pollard
mac apple servant here color scheme
you know totally
yeah i think that's probably get it okay so let's work order
um multiple
case colors
pay yeah stick with the same kind of
kind and
yeah the same basically k_l remote kind of remote design it
cool
right so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour i
um
went the uh uh like my father like you to work on just the basic look and feel what can we accomplish
um
given these parameters at least gonna sort it out this kind of uh
noah remote remote
uh um
so what are brought constraints before we devout design of prototype
and um whirl if you get it
figure out how will probably best to lay out this idea of the simple design with the voice recognition delta and in also this
kind of drop down it
or
oops on the site kind of menu option is a simple
so now all working out how we can get this oh it's in the same place
um in if
and if you can check product evaluation can some
pilots are stuff um i need you guys to work together and make me a prototype
at um
hm using
uh
prototype building materiel
yeah uh with
and also um specific instructions will be sent email you coaches as marks so that's at the start with your hands that right now has to include says goodbye willis
alright
this was just it detects text gasp
k_l
okay
yeah
question okay
t_c_l ritual tools
yeah it's or maybe just a little bit means
japan students there
true if the there's no
oh okay
i'll set yep
portable been
for lower rate it is powerpoint time
i don't more powerpoints in this particular experiment but
i've ever done in my wife before is curving
but just compile it
huh
to say hello uh here we have our detail design meeting and where we will um
look at b.s prototype
yeah and um d_c
right so un um
i finally figured out what this whole second bullet point it's about in my them a coach was thirty thirty minutes i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous me oh really okay i think oh
i don't now up
otherwise it just saying i mean those secretary in an
therefore taking the ins so so
just to go uh room
just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting in it
uh horrible little bit okay um slower
n_l_p
que alright
blow wait for it
it's tsk tsk
sh uh will
he annette's
now it you know
yeah this uh d_c
this
this is this is it very
high-powered steph yeah
the whole click it very got
so um basically the more the store from our last with a uh last meeting was that
i am lee
there we had meetings from uh we had presentations them by the industrial designer or will for making the wrong end of sarah about what we can give here
um in wed
sort of limitation s_e_r operating with
um
i was humility ages are operating under
what kind of or risk would be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing
and wer essentially can the conclusion that we should
develop a remote with their voice recognition either had a vaguely non remote light shape um because you didn't really use it as a remotes as your features which are voiced
uh would include \'s um
most see just the simple design features for television operation
dot with the uh slider fold out the for more advanced functions for users
um and uh the uh uh
uh the u. i. d. in the idea were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype press a look at
so i'll i
that sorted back to the main
neat here um it
go i hadn't particularly guys
well
uh
we have sampled a ah
proto tie um
what's we set of doubt it
um
we take into account a lot of the things that we were number and the last meeting uh
some the most important things to consider our that it's
we had decided not to go for the touch screen which can say in here
panned opted for some
beret
bar r_j
buttons for the
primer eh
functions
um
this going to be the on off by hand then we have
these binds to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons done here
that we send there's within less important
uh by ends
and then
pre the more advance
uh function stairs a slide uh
panel year
uh um
you can see that talents for the things coming on
but this actually can side back in h_m_m
pride very nice a static one in sub put away
um
it's for is the uh call this white thing we decided to go in uh what's what colors on the one high level
if paucity that's annoying for some people a function
can be trendy down off perfect
um
no it's important to be weak talking quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh
faces
now and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural if yeah
two main we call
fruity
i am re-enter
okay no
um of course that's uh endured change wanted uh
i think you would p. desirable for the uh
for the regular product in their in their in their yeah
in that first packaging could be something a little bit more subdued but this this kind of something that can be done is yeah
um i and it is you can see on the television there
now we have the uh voiced detector device oh right uh
also plop them
i've huh
um zingy
so that out that will work quite well with
with regard define in see uh
contraption
um
what other things we see here well um if you give her the touch it does have a actually a bit of the spongy feel
um and so i think that will work well for her it's or market for the um
uh and uh
let's see twelve clearly there's gonna be some more colors and one not available
um
the do you have anything else stand for that
uh um
uh weren't about the materials it is
uh entire thing is covered and uh rubber coding
cents very
dour of or
uh suck and it
break clic sometimes a plastic construct
uh
of course as you could see if you touch it does happen i it's squishy
so actually important in out that the television
uh i'll
yeah i've if there's an earthquake or anything like that
they're e. it actually is a double instead
yeah
uh i at at a time but i think there is but i wrote the yeah
it company's name
oh well the uh yeah uh
uh it's uh it's is actually
nah problem inside uh
give me the story about um brock factory
um but
his thing case in a new uh uh
tucked her
um okay there's preserved of moaning
we've got the have or something you're not talking about making televisions egyptology and whistles and so if if the t_v chip
yeah fell compares off at least
a parcel only upon it
um
but i think that's uh i think that sums up the main features are of the remote number don't know if you guys have any questions or whether it's band uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything
no the
nature um did we come in under budget
i would to it
yeah this costs well to put this into a um pre action
working in a bow out
was our uh core list twelve
fifty year oh
uh um in this guy actually can then uh eleven ninety nine
sounds quite please would there
um
one thing that we did in t. allow
obvious you have a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons but we just one for a classic
rubber button
in in down
\'s as we did that
we did have to use as many microchips just quite nice that's well keep the cost down but i
similar has a one of
mode earn
i technology
um for example the voice recognition why ways is just a simple
i'm boat
down
h_m_m i think
if we shocked around for other manufactures
um
we might be oats to
get even chipper
bubble
do we talk about the was your
recognition uh option
oh no we haven't toss so uh
so it up on the back your real noticed this
yeah it here which is actually the voice recognition uh
yeah okay
i'll consul
and rubbed uh
it's i think it's nicely designed into the into the opera left
um other but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the way this design sorta research she must be another couple to come up with basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker
oh um designed that we're talking about are different
i think that uh he's given or proven
uh
ease of use then one not
yeah
an end uh
allows features
blake
the remote to actually talking back to the user in here
cooled my questions
no was a little anything that's do we have um other
i fly fighter words gains covers
in plain our those gonna be develop later once we see how the cup we have go or non
fiennes was used in nomination
well we didn't quite have enough which he we'll uh-huh
oh i was exciting apart and i don't you guys handy in my right
um oh
well up
as you can see this is just a mos superficial way out
end um
be very easy to move the guy
puts another way at just
or something else here like were
okay actually this bottom red ring here are just on clips
and then you poems and then he you've been hearing okay
and you've
plate on top of that so i mean there are are we definitely yeah priced out uh spongy you even sponge here
non natural look i'm materials which i think worked out fine we also continued on with the ideas of blah following
uh apples color schemes
with kind of the on mon later orange and signing in
it's not quite uh at faceplate it's more like uh studio faceplate
okay you kind is
it's simple enough that
and the factory it kane
we could variously credit from on it it
walks in a place such there
yeah it's pretty p_c
per men
the same time
if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments we could go yeah the faceplate way if you know any yep
it still non optional yeah unit very cool
just shabbat
right here of things guys that's
very free get work like it
pre lay it
um
what we need to discuss in el is the finance of it um i got mean you've got
need fried it it and number that actually sounds quite nice um
the trouble is i just given this by framing it's run it's a spreadsheet of the parts you have just
tentatively pull it in a way it's going to look alike
um one's gonna clear this how we'll quickly
by the looks like
so willie just
if we can just i am mics what's in here we've got this it's a solar cell thing right
right said within bag of battery but it it's in there yeah with the back okay
um and with recognition area actually doubles is uh
as you thought or celery and clever clever well then
um so i guess ellen mean we've got a bit of a um
it's uh sit this speaker in a sense at the same time isn't it
yeah air
it's just making use the same space seem decay spec
um in that case it's more of a single curved case i guess would be that the the general yeah one baby curve tsk tsk in
um the we've got uh rubber skin material basically threw her out
um
push button near face
um with this other dropped on so maybe we've got to push button interface is the way
um um had
yeah and uh um special
i guess is um it we've got out server would material or rubbery type material
yeah yeah fashion throughout yeah as i guess you have to mark special column special forms well
when she because it it is very and convention yeah it's another unix i like it you know it's
so bit looks like her
income units sixteen a bit over budget
um who chip is
so what we could do perhaps
s. simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells
um more take up the back up battery
he filled but
i mean i think that uh if we're talking about it being one and remain selling features being experimental with uh reason one
although it does still have a battery us i'm not sure that
know what the sellers on the i mean we could take
we take the battery out in the d. c. any probably work point nine eight percent of time by
you're gonna have to set by
cost center for that one percent or time
people con
see how black
my remote is working well maybe material in here people pierrette set
jingle one run spare to keep the battery
instruct scrap the whole solve battery idea because that's
seven type want to
the theme then we had
hm um
what's difficult we have all these things it integral to the um
tree-view design have it that we just can't back out of an uh that have to be
it seems like we have to go back to uh on
square one an
in a way
um if we're gonna tried the
and do one bit we probably have to and do must definitely
yeah um hm
although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental
i mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way you're working this is like in natural new
thing
but honestly if we cut that one piece our actually communion budget effect um and that's great okay
yeah i mean yield the sway me on the idea that
we are the main selling point could be already this ways recognition thing i mean which is that it's sorry yeah that's what sending yes indeed this young market mean that are we started from cell
i don't know and i mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the gain but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league
in the reality is
you know
per we've from an ideological standpoint i'd like to stick with the uh
the sil are still but
i kind of have to throw myself in a in that business structure in model yeah
and mid uh
you know like pick either or
i think that he i think that we need to come to compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project
with the the source in all
yeah i think s. for showing that same best option sileye we were gonna
get ball though
uh call isn't no
twelfth f. t.
\'cause we can't remove the push-button as goes
they are preparing her hate kind of um
yeah an and can't get rid of
the uh i mean it there
removing the
changing we case wouldn't be so much of the
through his hm
um no we change and a case materials
um
c. a it looks like to be the only fair
yeah so that would be a it's a major change but it
yeah
go alright
use or agreement on the
i for shrine i think we are
i think that was a good compromise you brought for it
bright
moving on long swiftly um so because now we just go to
the i_p project evaluation
which i will allow
concerts if they'll be me
um
cord oh of course sorry no problem
you'll each be it'll be great
think cal
from delhi quicker
okay i'm not at any given do that on purpose looked at it if you
okay oh basically i was just evaluating that um
from what we know of our products working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of each the things we need to do the use the things that look like we feel are important
um so i was looking it basic design things does have a filter function does a remote is the design what we wanted to do it our technologies up to where we hope they would be and does have a fully extended qualities that original market research was looking for
um
basic questions like you know does it turn on it doesn't respond to voice recognition and overall in general it looks like it's coming up to par um the only thing is with with the p_l_p panel that is gonna take some adjusting because he knew sort of interface
um
that looked like it was coming up graph but then once you get used to it it does make a lot of sense so i think overall where i have in the right direction
yeah co
\'s hell
like that's spongy t. on
yeah uh it looks like it's gone almost sounds are mostly works well there is a good deal here for getting a handle on yeah
it's i think eventually if we do um brainchild despite mean we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms a house and stuff but for now all the guys working in range we needed for sound
sol guide
there are many and then displayed in me losing the song um yeah yeah et cetera
it yeah
it is a set back byte
okay t_d kullback um yeah which we might have lost like the normal accurately
but me man
oh they want tallies anyway
i lost she's true
oh
right so um
this one's it bit and clear to me to be perfect
a fair um
it got this slide it
from the curl which
yeah and then she went connected to her
uh them
so i guess we are going to discover s.
for um
then none project process
huh um
and that is going to go into my report so i guess this is a point where we'd go um
uh our nd
over whirl
at looks like and talk about
i satisfaction for room for creativity and so far i've
and \'kay
have it all worked again s.
as in within the team links so you heard it says just kind of uh
i think it's an mike kind of thing beep um i think so
it is now with fear designers
there you go that that
com that's creole picks it up
they just issue a job in if i words okay yeah yeah there um
right
uh ruud
so any thoughts
rene concern is points here
yeah okay starting blocks yeah
when you get sobel buffer process
loose
uh-huh okay you know i think in general for a day's worth of work we actually give relatively productive considering the little amount of input we had going in
hm
um and the technologies deathly been held this really really interesting to try out all this stuff
winning use the whiteboard flow
no we're going whiteboard we could now if an account for uh really if
yeah and i said if you guys have been designing in here perhaps of the change but because of
prove constraint does it really matter
uh also
had i not been intrigued about the pen i don't think i would are used it along
i don't write earlier yeah i think they're seeking notes more often than usual this could uh that that's true
um on
was prequel packed though
no the point
i am disappointed i didn't get a no back for my personal coach
the racketeering personal coach yeah i mean i think there is the contents
okay
yeah but look if if anything let fever if you get a response two or three months
good
okay forget it would be kind of great easier up stick okay note taking anything like that when i'm walking crunching is that really what if they really need it okay
make them back
it's a slight and i think there is a lot of room for creativity we could do you ever
they think is no longer in till they had
budge he came down on us
um
and even that we did get it these in product and i hope although it's not everything we wanted it to be
yeah with the net roll it
it's with
uh organic regular yeah it's because it had a big data peeler in here straight at the highly resourceful teammates might i add with you'll always have class
yeah i pick you have read my fellow like really creative actually i mean yeah uh i'm impressed
the team mike was good
the prove that we were always full we did in ways a single bit of play that we use everyday
now y.s
all for those little contain because yeah we've been learning is the multi color way of gathering on every system is that we didn't have enough colors to work with
brick
can i for it back in fact
because you'd be given l. multiple since it really had been and water like uh missing
i well
what do you guys think about the road though though roles
uh on
thing would good
yeah it's fun kind of fund
yes
you miss
i think it's pretty clever as we're never able to sink it
too far
a_f track
because
ten to machine came at the right time
trim kind of thought on the gaps enough
the same time the hand of for him to kind of
just make things i do your own would just come
so if you feel like a bit the level information dropped off severe we over the course of okay
yeah
i mean maybe just me but i didn't actually get him for fiction think this presentation at all
they still nothing like that displaying it meaning i'm sorry
thank you a visit
so yeah i feel like that was that lacking but then you know it
fill in the blanks on your own level creativity upped
well i think that was i think that was an issue i kept finding with regard to what to do well no but also yeah oh well i know it's reporting about what each of us is doing is bombing give users to what you're doing
in isn't isn't much involvement and then i also felt like
you know lot our discussion would center around
the specifically what my task was because that was kind of thing interface where a large it's what yes or product with the but
um no the image though
but and then in the end i think urge else kind of material yeah
that's from
well i things one
the most healthful fein
and it as we thing
west getting there
uh powerpoint sides a day
put together when you save greyhound uh minutes that there's okay got all that done
in time
very much stuff
tool
yeah i think year leadership was quite get
it was us from
she said i i did she actually the common are fallible you're getting in the same way that is true when we get back i feel like i got way too into it
that's kind of a bit with the current scope in l. y.
uh give the rest of us the structure work red sign
their releases out the person i mean taking on like in a row
if for some of everything like yeah project project management agee organize crap is one thing that you you know sever party with your friends yeah i know yeah
walls are from
but you guessed all that you could keep
the m_l
yeah uh suspension of disbelief kind of like like that will wanna yeah
ex if a couple moments were just kind of he'd idea we were a little high for exceed
oh yeah and i know how to make this is that with but it
i mean this is we got the play that
but but uh any only imagine
hm
you know the whole concept are really trying to stick with reality went out the window to make the cabinet in it
maybe i get like us you know
possible that like those to like make a remote control
yeah or spatial appreciative spaceship like us jasmine's build speech coding like that yeah everybody knows totally that species either
um you guys feel like uh as as teamwork problem
yeah clung so
oh
yep
went
clean-up
no i don't know i d. i general now i know i have is just
no i didn't actually i mean other than my discussion meetings there wasn't it's a for the actual building
yeah
but i extract the like if this was a team priortau should have been
much more the k_l_t rib like brainstorming use the board
well this would have been six months worth of work and out why
yeah at three numbers were two meetings
i mean i think had there should be more serious are probably whether brainstorm or during meetings this year
yeah
\'cause i'm i'm conscious of the idea have
it the project manager asking
yeah you guys feel like there's he'd see him
can i say i kind of like
i_c_m uh-huh
he be in those can have
but out you know
in just saying it
it's kinda far something without
i mean all process of wonder why is there anything about the where we got so much from it was like at this point to the
the port
i don't know what uh and of the was ever minus the mikes i don't feel like getting up or down doing with all these wires i was afraid as accessing
then my so lucent
h. ten to get up it's
so most body ending i'm or something contain water
yeah why don't know what i would have shown on the board
true but it didn't even occur to me is an option i mean i don't know but i'm whatever but i know that i'd consciously didn't
i mean it's just like the pave or i don't know what i really need the paper for
true
um
because of got this lap time
yeah at
senator i just use icas is whether the rating friendly
he always to the output files literally sounds from the digital paper until near my handwriting looks like digitize because many score
for rap
yeah
i mean it's is still looks like in
key d. f.
for matter something
usually i would do a lot we're dealing too but i all i felt like i needed professional sufficiently trolling within utterance up
yeah okay blocked not entirely
but step unsuitable this this and you shall eat it
i i'm curious about what the de briefing is gonna be like you now like what is the uh
or exactly were looking for here
so solid need to get through
i don't know i'm not sure the your new ideas found
the is it down t. s.
he'd did he just say newman that we need to discuss that
woke
that's the thing i got in the email i got this powerpoint file but this slide whiz
yes that it was like that wouldn't
i'd in changes when locking
wow i don't have just one the right track
yeah um oh
any new ideas with regard to ear
who were very regal comments that okay now
i'm kinda like on i think these to do their job
the yeah you define as i am thinking outside the little square box that will
but that little really
uh in like four l_m
i i noticed a circle be height yeah
does kinda make you wonder i mean
how much can you do with remote control
take in making it color at
yeah yeah you got it technically car shake the wap another round yeah
till oh
how to
um okay let and kinds of this as other back into
i don't know
i think this is cool how long was i mean supposed to me how much time before you shout out and i moved we should go on a bit yeah but the project eval um
i don't but you have but i thought like
at bit
bind your stimulated on the whole thing
like what like you know what i'm i really dealing
you know one is
yeah at the beginning it started out that they'll actually like under pressure like the first couple yep checking out of work and i was like they'd like all these brainstorming i was doing and then suddenly as well as just another to my presentation that you guys really care motorized oh yeah
uh yeah definitely be legal in a name like we also yeah you only read it with it so it didn't feel
yeah definitely a matter really when i first thought up there
question as marking it pi higher in terms of how much i had to how much i stressed of right but it's having doubts the last
whenever ach in at
thing does also realization of
b.
basically just copy and paste what's given to you end your does she in
which uh
wasn't so clear to me that ian or
i actually didn't do that or although every single one eight all the presentations i either added slides or adding them
o. added like five slides that's yeah we counseling goals
i just got like ones that really plus size world like they have a title maybe up money we're just empty which you do not have that in like a man yeah they didn't come like this like with
this is well it's like this is those other area of it but really just sort of the
in one way years always looked so more
complications of per per
that's needed slides yeah in
yeah
i think add the slide one time
and many slides every time in in w. background hynek anything that was pretty cool as class time on it
man expect
now doesn't it
any other thoughts come the mind
so we know how a project truth
here
i can't is you would fail huh
leveraging extension socialist like that are not kate and along with it at one hundred eighty nine if we skeptical that it might be an elderly had even you would be that we kind of decided to the global like
face
even if the image everyone is happy fancy actually that looked a lot more like a time become previous to uh
can builds other design um
modifications
known
i hope you appreciate the incorporation of some ten file from a yeah today
random kitty-cat acquiring that can be consumed by accident it
interest saying
gli huh
interesting day all the k_l uh you guys this um
so again a i reiterate mike
caution
half different we arc
compared to the alley groups especially between culture
groups end in uno
the um i'll
it's unless everything flow pretty logically
you know from the p_c
the basics to the cards i'll up the whole concepts thing that all concepts phase i don't think i really
unused do it like the concept
what actually i d. okay can notion of functional i don't yeah i mean it's not like i have a concept of a monster material is just now
if it was a really it's
yeah you know maybe oop
well then concept should be should be thought out we should i i thought i thought rather than in terms of concept i thought of it in terms of um
by d_c
it to proposes
idea yeah
and then the final would be back the the actual specify prototype or whatever i don't know
uh
hormones can i just sent
so we have word slides in
no just this closing won't
we've established at the carts word really within budget but we could
it's you know with audited me
we get any project evaluation based on were um
let's error it's evaluation of
oh close with filled is really technically
and evaluation up the product's not the project
in general um which i'm not sure as the same thing at the time that just it make more sense but
i could see if they will really asking about will
i'll i'll ice
yeah though
because we'd it we had if i think about it um
yeah
it was all recorded um it well though but um with
are supposed to do this final report thing in the end so output all that into the final report as well as much as
tombs like
maybe not like the articles and stuff like because it if and so forth but opposite mostly elements
it be so being is an a copy of the recording
uh i had to done i
huh
i had done transcription for and it's really ridiculous how we words people say like
uh just in in other centers like that that mean nothing
the whole badger psychology a look so that psycholinguistics
well the other testimony here yeah he steady flows and answers or something yeah
the call the disfluencies disfluencies unto could word for it
yeah we like our cats he
phrases and jewelers we just add some pre fixes sounds class here exactly
uh will save this in to the
propped you find my site hitting the send receive button on the
no i just have no yeah i controls and later
riesling some yet
command misinformation about to be fair or work with the world on the internet
yeah so heavy that we are at x.
not scarier
it is very easy i'll just throw on that evening and imagine we with the first ten fifteen years of our lives without the internet
it's only allows ten the work was hearing it
i mean there or it just in the past five we learn from twenty eight modems to brought back up all the time
do chain-link we've had internet pre likely to use
no we yeah but i know there since it's so on it you know it's not right in my group here and telling me t_vs and i got it ninety four
let stale screen easy
yep so
in the eighties d_c
my um grammar does computer science back in the states and so they had um n. e. d. u. and got network um there's basically the fundamental structures but it wasn't
uh helpful parceled yet right \'cause it hadn't been
yeah it was true the complex selling our senators nor yeah
has hem
you guys rid the celebrate
yeah i thought was does that include like a billion or something explaining uh
should home
i used to have probably call them being two of here and
i deal desert closer
\'cause in forty minutes were
the screen one uh
that's alright yeah yeah from
who depend on it
who who
i came in only a get
so the only um song yeah
whose um other ones
okay this is where is media player
huh get
oh i'll some
i believe onto the i thought it was david girls looking really i pop that's what it seems to be shipping with it but i will ship with for only this than the original
so that close yeah i guess will call that okay never
and and meaty
fab
they could you element
okay filling up siding
okay
on
like we pose the criteria
they'd
h_m_m h_m_m
um voice ever
okay have anybody rage
shape so uh i think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves
yeah that's a good aim to um his name in what you are function is so maybe you instantly feel
yeah main imac fans or not
and i and uh and user interface made order s.
the un the
main responsibilities you set interface um and my role it is to design uh uh
television in general what controller uh-huh
okay
uh the i'm a marketing person um uh one figure out how to sell them
huh and your name is my name is eileen
okay
yeah uh i'm jana b. um uh on my list industrial designer
and my responsibilities are and rob
uh
uh on
a deal with the technical functional designed and the specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design
any good
and as you or you know oh i'm betsy i'm the project manager for today
so when it we look at the presentation that
or to see what we we are we are supposed to do
okay
yes it opening acquaintance
tool training while of
do tools
uh i i think re already
i guess the tool this really our to computer um as far as i can see
um me get instead each of us will get instructions and we'll take it
from leah
project plan that falls under the same heading picking match uh um i don't think we have any great discussion at this point
who
um
or here is what assisting should be
this thing we are minor
uh me
uh designing always in your remote control
i threw people regional
um train deep
and of course user for
we've
on
so maybe and make some notes or the math
okay look
uh right
here is what the functional design
he's supposed do it chief
uh l_m
that is it's gonna be in readable work and then at the meeting will discuss
what
uh in
we have come up with
the same go all sorts of conceptual design
they will be individual work
and then discussion nafta works
detailed design
oh same thing
three different types of design okay can be concern
g_m_m
h_m_m h_m_m
i k. i_u system
maybe we should reaches none
but since nothing
yes pick
q. finish their remote control get uh
now it
then tool training try add the white board
but to control their favorite at a mall
does anybody of one to go and
see how the white poured works
so that
teen case we have to in the next meeting present something on the white board
you wanna go highly mend
the pales here that i can there
whether you'll
so it without changing or stuff
since her amber helped yeah
draw kitty cat or or parameters
it good
and remember you have to press so we were there cause it and then
copy a
that fact vector i think that i
very fat
uh yeah at uh
s_p five
uh okay that okay
bins you were
front seem nice i would you like me like just to see um yeah how it feels so that you have a little idea
or was it was a work off
uh i'm no
no that's okay
get do that late
ten okay
so it it from uh
it my
this mean that clean address really
i like not not backed up
i don't think you together coming groups of the like this
i have no
for
is a project finance uh uh which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing
um selling price is supposed to be twenty five here all
um profit aim for the company is fifty million euro
you market grange on limited
the the inning international
in \'kay
and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less stand twelve
fifty euro
king and that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged um no
it in
there's always a polling the things of course you're
to remember is a budget dinner when you design
to remove
materials cost that set draw
now
uh did discussion i guess it is
ah um
does any i wonder if you would have experience ways
remote controlled
their elbows
as it is even be user reuse them right everyday
uh end uh um
now help
having used in the remote control for years the say anybody already have like an idea yeah
like things you didn't like with its things you would like to change things really like to improve with this thing yeah i d. first ideas
d. like he'd be smaller
bigger
yeah how more have more buttons on it or or maybe clearly better marked
but um in see or know things like that
yes i i feel that all the remote should be very come back to smaller right there was mystery get yet nowadays it's very long
h_m_m hm and um
and it should have multipurpose like add that a remote control which we use like deviate it should uh it should be used for uh for some other purpose also make
controlling uh uh delta agent inside the house of it add condition as of a heating system so it should be a multi function all
uh a gadget is that it was uh control your household uh machine space and way exactly
all the tone room
twelve
fifty euro leds
per or
but that's about it but well
oh knows we get a really good side or maybe we can do that
we certainly can turn to a group of it to market something successfully should do some more it should be something new should this is it should do something different then then just folded happy now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design yeah design should be yeah i should be displayed on the almost like a train you know like another thirty every so maybe to be something trendy you know maybe in different colors or materials so our you know
um so yeah shapes right you know like kidney shaped first better in your hand or something else good from the for the yeah
that would hope
i think another thing that would help is i_m_s
is with
it
beeps when you clap
because i think one of the big things it happens a single lose them they can't find it
that is cho
they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plan door we or whatever and and there are some either farming so they want to turn the t_v off and see why
hoist
my remote control all yeah
well or yeah or you fits really
if it's really et dark spot
that he keeps out that uh same-store signals and yeah definitely to to give last slide should blown even lost uh signal is it me or solos signal you know and and maybe to have a light so that we can
we can just recognize rated these
exactly i mean just the ends as i say i'm just saying solo signal meaning just whether it's uh feeble whether daylight savings and i'll good
co uh um
clue poorer um there is that
it would respond to her
p_l_p
or we respond
to your avoid is
or with respond on what what should you have to do to make it be per point okay my my idea is maybe that
the minute it's really hidden in you know the words if it's
like
in a dark spock
do nd
uh meaning you are like newspaper is on top or sweater is on top or it's it's behind the plan
at that moment it's it's like it's like uh um what you call it the light set the sensors you know oh in in that loaded has a sensor yeah if it gets a certain darkness
it get has a sensor any to give sapa signal
whether that be a light signal or a beep i mean that we can discuss less later you know
and so the work terms we're
after with the signal that's right in that you know it would be
the right you have to have some kind of sensor
and i i think he uh voice or clap being that's not specific enough
uh i know they're the lambs and stuff you know you can n_l_p on and off
but i think the only work
to certain degree i_p
it can be someplace really out this and you still wouldn't be able to find it
what those layers in
well because this is because you silly because people is oh yeah well but then those going over can help library but but
my like on top of your bookcase and usually captain of a coffee table
uh um
you know what would be how you have to move along the i mean it will uh but i think we have some good good points to start with him
okay the next meeting will be in thirty minutes i think you're old did you get the notices on your computer with this okay so will you that the node is um
uh it
it's a working design
i guess that's the funk chin i d.
uh we stays the industrial designer
yeah
that's you
yeah and it's function on yeah exactly okay so
we are looking for working design win we come back
uh looking nice um yeah it it sounded
they did with the functional design and then the technical functions you the technical functions those and so you were the working design so we are working design
and then he functional design
and the marketing matcher is coming up with some user requirement specification like frame
in tests and what we just discussed in general
that would be your were
i india
end of course price
but they said it that the price is uh could price um i mean the price is given but
the that we \'s
we have to justify that that's right uh having sufficient features to make it sold that that's right
and and you know this but you you will get specific gear um
instructions for that i think that's the end of the gel
so uh um huh
the have well we have a
twine
two to two to three minutes
um any questions that this point door uh
suggestions
for them i think basically
basic we do we'll get instructions
it to work with
and if you have any questions in nine
oh okay switch room
okay i think i have and
to think about toner next meeting
h_m_m h_m_m
we'll achieve people yeah islamic yeah
p_r_v cake
right worlds and and see
then uh rees see you in a bad thirty minutes
and see what we can come up with um okay it really are
okay or in
so um i mean agree or uh
convicted this now i think we have to keep it yet
acts
i'm
uh-huh
cool okay
think
h_m_m pull
okay
seven clearly ready her
just uh latency is is it yeah
hm hm
okay at
um
i take heed you all have
received instructions uh scusi people
he pushed plus fifteen
eh and
uh indie
i finished a marketing manager program should call
first start
at dressing the needs and desires
okay you register an elk
yeah m_m_m
okay i'll put you on what must lots of \'cause i think it might be helpful yeah uh we looked at the slides at the same time okay
yeah participant four four percent for apple
he's um
okay all i can phase
i mean adjust ourselves so the functional requirements uh huh
uh a is
his board michael but whatever pastor to the seconds long
this that's where my discussion served by well um since i'm in charge of trying to figure out what
we should put on this things as i have to try to sell it
um i thought that they method i should followed be gather suggestions for everybody
uh on
and reason i just put that there are like uh a uh is
the uh initially in the initial stage i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions you could say anything you want them or how silly it sounds and her children your car achieved heat up your remote area chip
um term under see quite africa by picture to um and then as we go on
all will have to do is except in the women a these suggestions according to um design budget feasibility so i'll be coming to you um frequently as the industrial expert deja only
how hard it's gonna be a need to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be a or if your time is takes five years to develop this is just something that can't do
so they be getting just have a big
puddle of things that we
anybody can throw anything in um and just wierd things out that can't be done for one reason or another and then i things that seem the most attractive that
to uh a to a customer
which are then prioritize that was times so that was um what i met there
uh and as i said on slide there are consulting the industrial engineer about that
and yeah i think his timing is really gonna be as important as money because if we're gonna sell this thing
i think the best time to sell this is christmas press up
twenty five euros makes a nice it'll present
and we wanted to be an impulse purchase we want somebody just siete and think it's gee i just gotta have that
and take other while in by it so it's gonna be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by september \'cause anything that you don't have already out there in september showing it around isn't gonna sell for christmas
um should
and then i'll be coming to your as the user interface per seven to try to tell me you from your point of view
me what
pa the most friendly features that we could put on it
uh um
try the huh
prior hell be without prioritize in fact uh of uh of the features and of the you will work and the color and
i'll be coming back to your to help me deltas suggestions from that point of eva so we coming to you for how much is it gonna cost and how long is it gonna take your
and i'll be coming to your to channel me
what can i may let somebody take up there while i you know what what what what's gonna really be
what they call the syls all fit together still this is all
do
uh a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of here is in the thing that somebody's really discovered take up there well and buy for christmas for
for their child or for the house mind or whatever else okay can we go to the next slide please
or i already did a little bit of research after first meeting where with your out some ideas
and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the above the whole house idea up really isn't gonna be possible
so i'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where we saying it could suggest anything i'd like this suggestions to be really specific
so that will have all listed means we can cross off not something like you know whole house control
well tinker
i don't
and then i i found on the internet from far my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible
at the budget that we're looking at that the price point we're lucky that we should be able to make it work the t_v c. or the stereo uh with set
um
maybe something else cube like a coffee pot or one other apply another maybe only up
can i add this one way or interject um something um we have received instruction from higher up at that certain things should not be
at consider it
okay uh um that the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext because that's so far outdated
okay see intonate
and time
according which to to higher management
the it should on bit control the t_v
mostly because they feel that leads to clump complex the task to um to to encode other things
and they are concern with the time to market
of course in i okay
uh so andy and there's third saying that they wanna make sure
um that they have that the corporate image is being maintained and that the corporate color ink design are being used on the product
so that i_ds easy
add that
that they can be easily identified as a product of of
of of the company he and that there's no mistake but it could be somebody else was being this out
so i just one evening to check this here so we know pinning
too much off track here with uh with a things you wanna look at these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things without only gonna be t_v
but the one thing maybe that could be uh and they may be set teletext uh idea
okay
hm tab
alright thanks rat
um
alright now all of the things that i found on on in my research is that the complaints of people have about remote controls that are out there now
so lot of mode take too much time to learn how to use
anna i'm
that was thirty four percent it even more important the thing that we did address and our last meeting with frequently it's lost somewhere in the room
um so those are two things that we definitely do you wanna winter s.
our wants to make it as simple as possible wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use
uh um
then the
things about finding a at
we talked about uh i'll light emitting inc as well as uh maybe beep
and i think that those are things to after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate clicking on the next slide please
okay so my personal preferences ian this uh um project
or are we really have to concentrate on the sizzle
that is the selling point the thing that's gonna make it it impulse purchase
uh because once there's no be backed well in sales they always say no
the back still come back
is all this is or come back and get next week you're does
they never gonna come back and bite you gotta make it attractive enough so they buy now now now now was a big oily
in my book for it selling this thing
uh and in order to make it really salem all we've got a shorten the learning curve make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use
we have to have the as few buttons is possible
peak as more buttons is more confusions that's why i'm saying simplicity is good
finding it's important obviously can't user if can't find it
so gotta concentrate on the features that help he find it
and i've already said this several times but i put it on writing here wishing been attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros
so it has to have an of valued there
when somebody look said that this uh at twenty five euros um i can take that
as to be so great
that they're gonna say back twenty five euros isn't much
um uh and then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use their marketing campaign
okay that's uh about e. from the right now
help f.
yeah nd uh
who would be next uh
i guess that would um new
hm hm
you want me to get your reaction a washer thank you
uh yeah i dunno but
through h_m_m too
know anything
i can make tough was clean
c_e yeah
number acts like
yes yeah
can um
sure yeah um the first type
uh-huh
uh uh so to be i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller
okay uh on
go to the next slots like this isn't it
the method is like uh in a remote control you have a chip integrated so cute which is like of pre after remote controller it takes the power from a battery see battery it can't be and and like an electric supply like you have to uh like uh the switch it can it can it can connect your uh remote controller to uh power supply from that you know electricity or something like that it should be a battery
because uh the remote control should be like you you you should take it to do with it what you want and then uh uh the this integrated circuit it it takes energy from the power source and or whatever like if you press a button it's like the input for the remote control that and it takes the input and at
it it transforms into a in front in front of bates and sense it it to the device like t_v audit eight condition or something like that so uh remote controller is specifically designed to a single device if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequencies
like other that the remote controller it sense some but some
uh behaves like but a particular frequency the device shared know what the frequency is the chip
figure three to could nice there
uh babes which are coming from that remote control it and it should be the action like if you press a button channel or something like that
then uh the remote uh remote control will send out send us uh do a set of the signal and the t_v it should
translate that in do like change
did channel or something like that change the volume control in
and
uh so uh i think it's hard to design a remote control or for multiple miller devices
yeah well no that's already been a one minute yeah management cells are often
i hear right
uh
so uh i'll user interface controls the chip
and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user interface like oh you know switch pad or something like that but and should be there so you can control what the way you want you want to change the channel you want to control the what you do you want to go mute at mute the t_v all you want to have a child lock all you want to do some operations this it should there should be some device to tell it what to do to the uh in uh
integrated side cube so that the integrated circuit can just send the signals in t_v can perform though
actions
so can you go to the next like bees
\'s i i just would like
to uh at some extra features to the remote controller and uh i think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the uh open loan or investment also it's like no
the text or button so which uh which are they had on the uh remote control read the
those we can meek
uh on uh like flowed ascent
h_m_m
uh they'll be late light emitting if it is dark so that you can find you out
remote controlled look
if it dis doc
and uh at the should be other beep
as many buttons are pressed if suppose i try is being with the the remote control and uh she she or he is pressing the buttons on it at the time then there should be a be seeing that it did this is not uh oh would you know uh
oh action did the it can be not action taking do that so
and he should be outside you lock
like i'll put uh you you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh
and that what they were buttons are pressed away a child they can't be leaving you you if you if you have to keep kids and non and the beep living with remote control or so
can lob
there are two kindly that
yes so make it usable from more than one device at so it's hard but
that might as possible yeah well that has an inner yeah that's eliminated so still that it's a
question yeah move point yeah um and uh different she'd so that we can do like uh we can have you know at all adding machines or you know comfortable
but you've it which can fit in d. r. hansen
um so i was added a marketing point of views yeah i yeah function in colors also different uh it's just that one had too much to the budget to normally should i don't think it would be like you can have you know full that if you wanted just then that we basically yeah yeah yeah it's else just just cheap so it doesn't matter as a bunch of it looking at if you
filled one well they don't even better make a big difference was gonna be square or
do you think there's any chance of um having sir in harry basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes
yeah that is also has a slightly an idea that might make it more likely we will have to get a budget on that but i think in principle that that would be that would be kind of funny because we had something sort of sexy for adults yeah you have something sorta silly for silly for jamaican and analyze jail and then tell you a little relevant so they can remember where it is
in your point
and and uh the but um buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons if there are more buttons and then it will be more complicated if you have less features than your remote control or won't be attractive so i think we need to make some buttons which are which are like i'll than uh for
uh in a thing didn't it for two or three operations like if you press one button in one more would then it will change the channel if you press the other button and and have them or it will change the under so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will
complicate the matter more than it is now i think i think that that's something that we have discussed only where the user interface person is i think there's a lot of argument tree image for uh one button for one feature so i think one of the things people were complaining about my when i found out my research is to when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one yeah
the changing modes whistle here it's like you i mean you know all for all four of us who work with computers all the time changing modes is nothing for us for people who are a little elderly a little less thrifty and you know and
and it's a small button and and then they don't press it exactly you know something else happens and not their favorite channel comes up or something else anything very frustrated and saying how i think you will learn by feel
and um yeah i mean you don't you don't feel the change so um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be of help yeah shapes also differentials the triangle is for the volume of the square is for changing channels and so that people can um yeah uh develop a tactile sense of it but we'll get to that were few and also takes should be really clear so that they they won't be any ambiguities that's right yeah no that's a good cause
and uh display clock about it if you want more features than we can display o'clock it i'd i don't think it will taking money extra money because anyway we haven't included so good i think we can just definitely feedback features into the same gives you know that's that's a good that's a good um because the clock on a really friendly as
and when one is your favorite chill coming out
then indeed you
i didn't know whether there is uh a lot of time is not a clock on the screen and you have you know somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute yeah that's that's good the corpus going
okay uh can you could to the next slide please
uh company and so are the main components may need for uh uh it out like buttons
and that uh underneath died there should be sweets
and uh by that's
like i'll be can have a bug like whenever we add all predicting that remote controller or
uh whenever the t_v ease on suppose then uh the remote controller should automatically have on a sort of a light
yeah hm
then it will be like if you switch on your t_v to another another so was not from two loading work remote controller and you have you lost your remote control and maybe you can find them in the light
her me
maybe we can half that whenever the t_v's on remote control will half on the light
um
and then uh infrared bonds now um this is like um but then it is don yeah
um
and a bad to be there should be a battery for power supply
and at chip
chip which is like comparing to the remote controller which does all the operations
and lice connecting god chips which is
uh lights everything's so there should be myers
and i'll uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the kings and you know different sheep somewhere around the base station b. keys differ
to give mushy have remote yeah
pace
a key score that and would have in the folder yeah
hm
next it's little please
uh
i have for a full or the site
uh oh
the whole beach off there
um we
uh i've it site uh from in a half hour
i caught its few points
um set not to fun
okay
so it um wish and visit the site and have a look at uh what's on uh um
oh without have to uh it's not like that i have referred to please to get knowing the answer may well what can be the working design too
how are
works and not dismissed so it might be helpful to have a look at them
oh if you want
okay toaster
did you go back to that slide wishing that that those side up that's it
uh it's actually the in now
did on the screen and this fun
yeah okay thanking
um using this thing do
yeah uh yells too
no hain three
two one three four individual sorts of these yeah
okay or
as uh user interface design that i did a little research define a quarter the features which are used so would like to have on the remote
hm hm
yeah okay this goldman's night
so i find add that
uh uh uh do the beep office of our remote is to uh
control of the function enough liked elevation
at a far enough distance that triple would distance
nor for that uh a remote control or should have a search on off back down
by the to use it can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t_v unique in control of the functionality is different functionalities of the t_v
there should be a signal to uh or something like that you'll be able order infrared light a delay which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels are in please or volume you can change it
um of
yeah they should be sometime like the set for viewing the politically a particular program last switching on and off of uh of particular program according to the user
also i lost all their remote see yes oh yes
if if it model view a particular program let's say and i know clown he can set the tying run the t_v would automatically research on at that particular time um
so you can use that kind of uh of properties of features
and then there should be a try out system if a particular channel is not be anywhere a particular uh find the time set in each then debating scare anti-lock that particular channel so that that children cannot view them agenda
um i'm uh the uh the uh and the mind of the feature are you still would like to have is the compactness of the gop are remote
hm hm hm
at the remote should be gone back then it should not it should have as many buttons as possible file controlling different functionalities of the t. v. television
and uh of the uh as uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of fifty and alphabet far more compact ability
um leaves
and uh and uh and eight this one will point which i noted it down like uh the material which it to which is used for the what should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something sounded the energy
by the children onto um and abundant buses and
and it should have than uh it can have at a lower clock
uh but as an x. i. if somebody wants to get at but down deep eight b. m. ninety gives at the time and it can be used as an alarm clock and i don't think it will cost too much to set an alarm clock is that and you want to show
if there is a compliment me on lawrence marking as jan reset the buttons can be uh get in may
we can use the for order cents
the liked at the back then is so different
uh back then split glow differently so even in there that the user can know what buttons to use the search on a particular channel
and uh that the design of the uh um um doing what should be in such a way that they should not being shot projections
so that if a child lace with that it what
he de he should not
be hounded in any rate
whom findings
uh i found out uh um and then different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used that adam was which you use the infrared bit for controlling the different functionalities yet adding words which used a video they use different protocols
trans
fine yeah
so did you have different uh types of fitting what's but different light source which i use which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of the television
you move
many of them had feel lesson if
preferences like it can be used when a multi purpose use
not act
i don't know and make it get it can be used as the t_v controller ask there's an alarm clock
to set and then um at binding and it should have a try block
and then the save electricity uh they should not be uh mike q_s move room and lots of circuits and all that
and if the person s. f. f. eight ins wise the television to be switched on by ten o'clock
then it should be switched off then up at ten o'clock automatically so that nobody else fancier dead and use it
okay it's like a time and time again time minutes and allow god to the television set down with s. yeah
three s.
yeah
on my slide show basically via e. we have worried on the agenda
air and uh on the closing yeah
uh basically they'll p. lunch break and all that
however
uh
the decision we have to take give these meeting is
cool is i would target group
and
uh
what function working design na
how will how does your work
so he's are the two things we should come up with with
so uh
the first thing is per maybe a little easier all the uh who is our target group
um
i guess in many ways everybody
everybody who has a t_v d_v_d television unix yeah and i think today they're probably not many people who don't have a t_v yeah they are a few but in general laughed
now talking about to target who
which is
in a sane so everybody but i think within the target group
we have s_t_p groups
we have we ever earlier in was mentioned about uh um for example elderly people who have limited from chin with their fingers and hands
so i think that's uh one pull
it that's sydney important
uh um
there we have just the nervous people who kind never press a little button on anything
um unless it's really very cool you're yeah
and uh i i don't know
how much free one to cater to it shows ensues
i mean that's a question
uh you you with her that's
important that choking can really use it
one non
so these these are just some thoughts i have on it it's yeah and um
i don't know what your feel about whether we can just say we have one target hon
and for this one target will be but it's a sign this one thing
all where the we looking at
what be like we've been talking about different shapes h_m_m whether that different shape also includes may be different
uh buttons in the h_m
uh a full or
it different groups
well you know there's they'll motto children under six never shop along um serve you design something that's very attractive to children
um the mommy please mommy please um want
you know we wanted now we wanna go to the store in see that
uh um that had as uh a lot um
had a lot of getting polled then had a lot of appeal but i think
uh i'm i'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we looking at different groups i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape um and we scholars that's right you know like you make it nice and paint flores and banana color or whatever
put it in a simple thing like yesterday this example you know but the question is really who is our target group
hm
eight do we look at a one target group
and
with a twenty five year are as you know can we can we afford still have
uh i i messed for the technical people here whether
um that
if to a look at
the sort of sub groups always maybe different buttons for each grew
how watch with that's robust
out toffs the cost we are supposed to
respectfully spec t.
yeah uh
gently begin begin design a remote which is mean he thought he better but the for each from our pain to um forty right and and then begin add-on down specific about functional but then split children as well as the elderly people other people but it with
we have now it's probably even maybe we can design different remotes for different people like for each to be there there will be big buttons and you know well
carnegie i mean there will be a schlesinger regimen in middle age but you get are likely different remotes
they would like the bite just one
and uh and just man which can be used they all the three yeah of course that we can
do but specifically leaf if
make elderly people wander big buttons then you you can't really make a big big remote control though
so maybe specific and you can design and did
on the remote control in the reading for children
what about the question marks that's not really valentine's day much and it it doesn't cost and out in that way that won't change much will it yeah um this doesn't
as it was it the question the question to be addressed here is a link with a target group and how well it function um
and
i things or how will it function is probably it's a question of the buttons you know yeah a within the target group or sub groups
the question is only be whether our budget will allow all
two
have
more than one design you need a sentence you know i mean the basic design um's there will be the same but the question is how much will that set us back if we'd say uh
forty percent pre make a large buttons and the rest we make regular bunny as for example now
so that remains does do be seen but
uh
tada grew
as a wool these
it's basically everybody was a t_v that's rare
this and can we can really is it even feasible to make
why am in one remote control with something for every one
or we have to to use the same electronics and make three different shape yeah well that's that's already in the same electronics and basic are always gonna be different as the plastic case and in that case we can
probable
molded plastic isn't all back expensive is it
and i don't remember i and i don't think numb
well maybe they is there's a nest here
in your notes the new for example new portable phones um
they have like remove oval
plastic cases yeah you can have a striped what are you can have the fluorescent blue wound or whatever and may be something like that that in each package you know you have uh there's a real or do you have you have for example uh would you you have let's say for a simpler one it
but then you have uh another call hours stripe whatever that already comes in a package
and then if people read e. want more colors they can bite separately
right yeah like little by if we want to be yes have uh different you know covers that they can do that to identify like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package
and they can go there's a store it for a few uh
frying sorta euros whatever they can buy an altar back and alternate package with another two colors in it you know for example i dunno yeah
bit
uh yeah i i have like they'll play with it because lies effective iffy iffy designer did more having all of the
uh
the p_i_n
features for different beep better on designing three different down
did moritz for three different categories of
people well i think i think the idea here is to do to design one remote to help yeah and what the only change is gonna be uh um the fun project that took yeah i have to update the functional uh functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way yeah um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people
uh i'd have with chilled and um
i've been is that was i guess that
that's killed message
where yeah
i feel email naps um
uh l_m
all we may have to come back to uh
only and the ones that are rex within a one but i think if we do some more research i i think disarming up the target group is basically everybody
if money permits we can i address some features for some sub groups uh within the act um
yeah elementary seventy percent is a unique uh um do we could agree on that on that in principle like of money will tell whether we will be able to do that on-off tokens
there okay so now i understand that's lunch break
yeah um the huh
so that's what we move do
so thank you very much no
and well he see you after lunch
to
\'cause
hm
looking
uh-huh
i spy
for i
okay
hello everyone high alright
uh my huh
how uh how we've going
yeah leaflet
uh first three going uh over and uh
minutes of there'll asked
my two more or less um you
uh um
in the last meeting uh the marketing
matt i'd sure
had present k_l_t
uh
ah her
method of work came meaning guevara any suggestions
from every one has to see how she bess could marker it
uh this
these product
at
the within the budget ten and that it was given
uh
in jenna all
uh is the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use
um
it's all sign item that people lose a lot
so oh
we you should address that
and of course it should
b.
something
that is very simple to you lose
yeah they should know that to make it
sell of course so uh that marketing matcher
on which says that it's be very attractive for like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another
so that the
people are buying it now
you goes in particular we smaller items that's a very important fact
because uh needs they say well uh like a home and think about it that won't work
uh um
also mentioned was he should be
uh if should have a very short learning curve
eh and
may be could be sold by using a slogan
our
technical manner at sure has
then said that she feels it should if it chip
that has infrared c_p_t
bits
um has an interface controls with interface the controls the chip
therefore message she's
um will be control t. in the same manner
you should be extra features like clique buttons maybe i'd be okay if too many buttons are pressed
um matt uh try a low
uh um
and uh
maybe had these play clock
so that people quit uh um
the could see the time you know what show they want to watch
also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes
so the components of the thing should be button by l_p_c input the infrared buyouts battery chips
wires and may be some kind of all holder
uh full where the
for the uh
i'd um
crunchy now who is a now were
um
interface in diff
ace designer
uh um
uh has mention deaths
the
there are of course should have an on off button
and also has mention an interesting feature that each we'd have maybe channel lock
particularly obvious maybe small children that they couldn't duh watch a channel that is undesirable
it should be compaq ter purse oh
favorite was it would beep t. shaped
and maybe have a none are alarm clock
and so material should possibly be enough of non never chips made sure
uh
the different systems uh that excess to our infrared or radio waves
uh maybe each would have uh electors electricity electricity saving
feature um
if and
yeah even possibly at timer
to sil that people can program
ah from
their favorite there
uh
program all um right from the remote
should
uh
are we all in agreement that that's a bad what we discussed last time um here okay
pretty much isn't known even
uh okay of then we
am looking for three presentations and uh i don't know whether they order matter so much
sure uh i don't which
i don't think so i'll sell whoever once it's set
yeah okay
i slugging he's right it's uh
han and then a
who sorry
that's number d_c who
three_d
three
yeah as an interface design that i would kill more emphasis on interface how they didn't work looks like
so that it descended then it does attractive to customers
do next here
okay no this one
enough loading mode is to send messages to the television
this messages could be a switch on off message i'll switch to next channel message us that being the jam is a switching line to a particular channel like you can have the numbers whiteboard t. for up to nine
nine what nine channel all uh
switches
yea um
nine channel switches yes you know nine number s. um
and then you hertz flapping uh more but then
my did using which you can slap the channels if we don't want to see this telegenic is map it to the fort gender on vice lesser
then it should have uh next to but then then next but didn't chan that that that you can keep on uh um uh scrolling the janis one by one
next slide please h_m_m
then you should have a backed and that should much get which can be used for increasing or decreasing the while you um
then they should be backed in which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going linard everybody should for example if you are watching the french program and you would like to have a a sub type this in english
then there should be a channel which can doing good this may gags them in the television so that the user can see
anna that yeah the subtitles on this can be
then they should there there should be some patterns which gain control of features like the kind out
i do not the picture the contrast shop and is bright and is
after pick joe
yeah they should be and then midi so bitch
they should be i'm new to but then suddenly if if if uh you know he gets a telephone call
and if you wan t. doesn't want to switch off the
uh t_v but he he gained reduce the sound begin
bring the why didn't down and enlarge speaking now by docking enlarge the t_v
not the most important feature that i would like to have in my room or what would be the speech recognition feature up
it's an integrated that robot programmable sample sensor uh speaker unit
so early mode can be can be uh designed which can had the why selected denies that is
you can direct claudia colon wise
hm hm
which can be recognized by as a voice recognizer in the television for example if you want to see me if we want to see the ninth agenda if you say jesse ninth jan there
as it had the uh yeah the remote will automatically do a search for the night agenda um so the t_v it had some recognizer which are recognized they uses wise and accordingly to change its functionalities none of this is one of the very important feature anymore
then draw it get have
so this is one of the one i've the interface
which can be create dead
um as they decent that interface which has all that uh uh important features
maybe these things i from
then these are some of the animal it's bits are different in shape and color but they have may need back then is um the uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that so you can you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly even a kid can use that
instead of getting bluntly then do the next slide
yeah
so this is one of the interface that but i didn't want which has this byte wise selected now is that um and this has might be part of the seals it can be used for a t_v can be used for cable satellite it can be used for b. c. i. d. v. d.s and audio
and this has inbuilt or voice recognizer
hm
we didn't it's not you
yeah
now this is an interface for to try to have fun adding looked uh uh object i can use um now this is yourself and needs of any object or an agenda and giving use it as it is they can be a bit
i'm this comes a bit different
d_s_l as different shapes
um and this this uh try to the interface has the minimum buttons
and all it be important
uh in buttons are dead and this mode compact
f. attractive
chided interface
so feels
now this is a making it always and i assume what which cannot be misplaced i'd it's implausible
it is a diagram
don't know maybe a
black
not or uh
they might have it is that
not a bigger get off
is it better to doesn't don't wait as a remote control it's important that the in misplaced almost certain
um
this and other than sighted the phase which can be created
and a place or prefers
um would be
s. p. uh de incorporate speech recognizers
average for response to use says voice but a particular uh function
quite
people that's
h_m_m um
uh okay thank you very much uh any comments on their her presentation
well um looks like we still have quite a choice it's things out there
um well it
oh poor
i'm
no suggestions bet yeah but are we gonna have to narrow it down a little more i don't think that we can get
uh
fifty shape is good the child one is good
so too big de misplace i think it's just funny
women
not not the
uh i don't think that's gonna be are impulse purchase at the checkout counter is going to be a little bit normally all these are representation about the uh as far as the decision making we get how to combine to learn after again but if i just wanted to know whether anybody had any he any anything to add to her no i think the presentation was grouping machine really to explore all the options oh
how was about an axe so um
yeah um okay and you only see i do
um
now the next one suburbs thinks history
com components design h_m
uh um
this time i'm i'm willing to uh um
concentrate more on the components mend the technical side of the remote control their design
uh d_c
to the ones on please
i had just um p_r_v uh dollar few uh components which we require for the remote control that construction
and the flows twenty set case
or to keep all the components like integrated circular battery it's if i'd set rides like uh it can be a plastic one hard plastic
so that it can be strong even if you just uh well you've you know if you
if it fall stone then it doesn't
three co so it should be strong and uh uh did out more harmful materials used in that
and it should be lease a cable
uh and um or yeah uh and also uh using of cutting com point components like uh if we want to have different colors blue red green
still have done the have to use a some kind of in component on when i components
and uh the second important thing he's out uh uh integrated set cute
uh the shit we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote control or if it is not a fish and then everything is going to be uh like out in the leftist less efficient so if you should we should have a highly sophisticated one
and it should be resistant deal high as well as uh low temperatures suppose or if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degrees outside the chip
it should be able to do to address is the uh ten preacher better uh
hi sin
uh
i can bridge and go down to just
and uh it should be with uh um equip it of it statement an alarm facility
and the uh i don't component we should know if we have in the remote control or is that a sister
uh over
which is like got it it is very very much important for the electricity uh overflow to to to the remote controller and also a capacitor which is up
which isn't home i think it's it's like a battery capacitor
and you're going to the mixed like this move
uh i'd die your what
i'm transistor
i'd resonator these out all this uh technical uh elected electronic components of the components which have which we have to use in a remote controller
a battery uh i would like decide just one thing uh us and we
uh if we will be able to make a three state rechargeable battery than because we need not go for um high performance battery even if it doesn't local formants battery it kind kind can be kind charge much it it it's not a hollywood respectively the and also we can if we decide rechargeable one then the people can use it for a long time so in that maybe can cut at the cost effective at at and that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one
and we we have a set queued board
uh in a remote condor there can go to the next slide please
and hope it works hold the remote control of works
when you press a button
okay
uh when you press a button when you do with that
you complete a specific connection that means it when you
when you press a button that will be boundless a small say cute
underneath the button and it will send some cygnus through without wires
and then the chip will sense that connection and most that fits button is pressed suppose you have pressed channel one but and number one you have placed than that of the chip will know that the number one button was pressed it pros it produces some more more scored line signal specific to that button
every button every individual button has it's all one more scored suppose the user has pressed her but don't button one then it would have is that the circuit will generate a specific morse code to put that that button
and the transistor mid amplify the signal and send them to the l. d. d.
which translates the signal into infrared light they get and you have got a signal by pressing the button that uh that uh morse code has been generated by the integrated so cute now that signal that most good has to be amplified by the transistor that is the use of transistor transistor be which we use in the remote control it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the e. e. d. and which translates the signal into an infrared infrared bits
this instead and the t_v can see the infrared light and seeing the signal uh
seeing the signal free it react appropriately that when it sees the amplified have more morse code signal and that it will uh it will uh both know which what what action it has to do then it will do the appropriate action
so uh this is howled though
the d_m_t controller works
can you put it next like s.
yeah i have few pictures when you look at the uh oh remote controller uh it's it's did it this is a normal remote controller
remove and and to an extent these
and they'll be harder than the few buttons and all and and if you open the remote controller you have this secular the sun keyboard and few electronic components like you can see a chip then and we just having eighteen bins and also up capacitor a capacitor three sisters and also resonator uh um
um in it yeah
and that and the day or would transistor
the electronic components out all of the electronic components half or those are things take the chip and
the day or want
in transistors and
yeah the the um can you you can see the t. a. w. one eight three five limited uh achievement yes um
uh you can also see the global did clicking completing things are uh these at the at the are they sisters and it just beside that you can see a transistor and the the uh cylinder shape uh that one is the capacitor
uh and also they are about i'll
m_g_e sister uh sorry
the that is that day would
um can you who want thanks
so uh this is the sit keyboard the green one is a circuit board
actually of building the say people board is pretty pretty easy and also it set itself to inexpensive it's it costs less than what you print on a people because they'll blow when you when you are building there are some
so cute some uh data set yields and also via it's it's better to go for printing because it you can build up these kind of circuit boards on the on a bulk and it's just printing nothing like what you know you don't need to use wires and all it's not exactly why as we are using it's just printing something on a board
that there are those prince will act p. act as wires and set up so it keeps
so that that green oh thing is a circuit board and also you can see uh they don has like oh um can access for buttons make it when you pressed a button there so cute under the button will be activated it will it will head and get some signals from eight
and it will uh it will achieve its to say send the signal signals to the yeah um integrated circuit
good good that makes it
uh so this is these are the sip u. um so on underneath the buttons
uh can you see the black car problem monks the the out the same cute
x. const
and um
like a movie have i designed a before we have seen some uh a few things like um instead of buttons to be had some schools
uh but but up a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it but we'll has a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range make for school pros we have to go for that
sophisticated and to
i'll i'll
load full of complete chip
uh and uh as energy source or meet offered a basic battery
um would ingenious a hide dynamo
um
okay indic provision of energy more than what is that your shape gadgety to provide energy so would that also be can have enough battery um or we can use solar cells
uh
it's interest
yeah am
uh yeah i the product can be dead delivered into different cases uh usually the keys this and carve flat so that we've we see usually uh uh on normal remote controller
now um
okay we won and you have more pictures um we have five minutes to the end of a mean of the uh i have just one more slide open
uh l_m
like we can have all my material such as plastic rubber wood titanium but titanium be kind to you most
um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular uh um quickly at orton advanced chip on print
um also info it includes the infrared sagae sender
um yeah the line for the movie distance of develop a sample sensor speak
samper speaker
yeah
at sit
it's all phone
thank okay i think yo
any particular comments i. e. anybody
uh the on the scroll the push-button
um kid you can achieve scrolling via repeated the pushing a button
no the the the the scrolling was a different like you can go first switches like buttons or scrolls uh-huh uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before a pink now
nobody users likely close you need you need about a cup
sophisticated tip and also lighting gets but do we go for uh in ordinary buttons would discover bleep buttons version look on his wrist of cost yeah
okay we don't have a lot of time left and real are still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present to her
okay uh other thing i first my next slide
now okay
um it's a in my method there is uh i'm interested in what competition is doing
and that wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition so i've really been looking at the preston the ads that are out there for other remote controllers
ice but i did spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around during the same thing
and then one em out um in people's houses or it meetings or anything like that
i tried and notice what kind of work controls people have
and if it's can be in the conversation i ask about it now and encourage you all to this same
um
an my findings from this is the
you know small was beautiful in
um people like something it really fits in there or hand
simple is beautiful they don't want to have to square it at small print um in one button cygnus functions are obvious
and they want um as few buttons as possible and they don't care for the mode thing they want each button to do something at eye-catching is important it's gotta look here it's gotta look appealing grad on trying to finish fast way
um hm to
and our preferences as far as i'm concerned are we gotta get to the market before the competition errors has to be
look really great in it has to come out before the others that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out they are christmas item
and we should develop one or two features we can really do well on in or add campaign if we try to sell people it has too many great features
um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get any worse you've got it narrow or selection down to
potent
two things i think that would get us a are we really great about our our our new product
um there
i will like you around the um at what designs every year different things are popular and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular
and people are targeted of hard plastic in hard metal there'd be more back into soft feel spongy feeling things things with maybe a little cloth on um so those are things we wanna look at as for his sale ability of the item
at yeah okay
uh
in bat
cover closer presentation of every one
and what we really have to z. size in this
me if being
in his
uh
the concept pos a remote
uh-hum
and uh
uh
so what give you think
c_e the concept
austin invoked
room and throw the come back to you as the movie any is a bit like we include this feature discard this voicing recognizer yeah okay
um um hm
in h_m_m
so speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned remember this could be up one feature which could be said that the
yellow that could organize agony
star feature that there won't be a really good idea in my remote there but i'm um many impediments doubtful how how
um a fight it will work
because a speech recognizer it like i could
t_s it
\'s one now uh
this is as usual was
yeah it's not distance problem it it's recognizing the person's ones lake maybe different people will be having different voices so uh like it did
every well it's new and you teach you have to teach i don't could recognize recognizing system that is being added thing is like you regarding uh about order uh um of creation or maybe
and then you are expecting an answer from for example you have a t_v system i'm the user h_m_m family members other you said i would already have a chord yeah but uh you know uh creation like
uh but mining like that on a program on to see the news h_m_m in the television so i would say it is good morning and the dealers which on h_m_m it recognize my voice
yeah industry yeah it before we get too far off here um the components of the concept is the energy
what kind of a energy view we
for c.
battery i think battle battery and i think we all agreed on that that that's that's gonna be most cost effective and the best thing
okay and then it chip on print too yeah well it's
okay
and the case and i think we all agree on the case we wanna have something either maybe bright color fall yeah
i'm broke over four noise was trying to do this ordinary designs wrong on that
c_p_t ma'am
bennett is eyeing compact and straw moves
user interface const at
uh
in to phrase type supplements
that will be your hair area i think right
uh room
like this which is like we use buttons for user interface push-buttons look like push-buttons i guess uh for her yeah
uh l_e_ds
not sure what i mean by supplements on so well with a different types of features but dense
yellow line you but more rigorously home usual are also visible uh speech recognition my right breast them yes
but this oh well we put down speech recognition if possible endings more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is right it's
okay aim uh
i would next meeting will be in thirty minutes and did envy
uh
i he
is too is is the individual actions to be taken until then
to have to look and feel design
and
uh t. u. i. t. is supposed to
uh come up we see user interface design
h_m_m and as a marketing expert with a product evaluation here in this phase the two of you we are now in the francine have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay
it sets here huh
oh
and you will we see specific
yeah instructions since he's
will be sent to you by your coaches oh king
um if you have a questions you know you'll you can always uh contact me
uh um or uh call your coach i suppose
not enough time that
any here hiding
three hundred uh than that is so
so um i think free concludes a meeting here a may come back here and uh
uh thirty minutes nynke according to our time take them
thank you wrapped thank y'all
a ps
pick it maxima
smack
really this
i'm
e.
points
can
okay okay
okay let
i like it okay
none of the are his character
yeah i think about about
good
part
i'll about
what looked
i
well heidi fairly one again
move
who there are
uh i'm
i mike before we uh
i have read user in meetings from than the minutes from the last meeting and will be okay and so
here we go oh
uh
it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was open by the presentation
from the interface uh um
designer right
and bat there
looks would be very important
on this no remote
and uh l_m
is to send messages of course dizzy t_v
it should have nine channel buttons and next but then volume buttons sub title buttons
switch to control features scholar contrast truck less et cetera
for different memories which are nude but in your case the telephone rings or something
uh est
speech recognition is one of her very forward favorite personal uh uh feature she would like see did do it do to be integrated in this um
t. in these new remote
uh um
should be child-friendly design which few buttons color fool may t_vs star shaped or other shape buttons
um
she here uh
presented also and over sized remote
uh we d_c
she guarantees no but he will ever be able to lose
h_m_m
uh challenged all my point but for
i don't go up but uh
and a very for personal favorite really she she would very much like to see you speech recognizer
integrates been this remote
the now still designer
um
present dude her
uh
the thoughts on the e. issue
she would like his special case made out of plastic studies very strong
not using any harmful materials
should be recycle a_b_l
and there should be collar fold
should have an integrated circuit board to her that's highly sophisticated and temperature resisting
she would like to see at time err
and the bore all our might
for silly cy
integrated
yeah uh technically this thing would also have every sister and incapacitated or
dye your to transistor
raise an eta
and you've possible we rechargeable battery
uh and of course the circuit board tri
and how would would works you press the button the chip
is some more s_t_c morse code related
read ace the uh to that
general eight
it to it it
generator amplification
and to uh um
this joe could
ward ease very inexpensive to build
and so she's things this is a great feature uh to to to consider
she would like uh
this hosting should be push-buttons with the simple chip
the scrolling method is more expensive end not that practical anymore
should be battery operated \'s
and of course should have to special cases
the marketing expert p_p_t
uh
for who has to find they come up
with to to to market his product
has been that watch in the competition
s. dams in research on the internet
and also
has used surfer personal observations to come out
we sir fact
then a tsk
such a remotes suit should be small
easy to you whose
any two p. i. catchy
from our point of view of course one as the most important facts is that we should get the market before our competition does
to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could well on or in other words on which allah com pain
could be built don
too many new features are too many the points would only confuse matter
so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really a uh
different home
uh um
it should have a fruit in vegetable design
and for differ soft field she feels that's really what people want today
and the decision that we talk less time it was that uh uh
the special feature we will like to seize a speech recognizer
the energy should be better e.
uh should be on a chip
should be trainee design compact and strong
and should have pockets
and that concludes the presentation from the last minute it's on the last meeting
now how uh via rating for the presentation of the prototype
yeah yeah
because they look collect the but yeah okay
uh so this is out what uh oh we have me that this is a model of the remote control and which we are going to be
now uh the sense us in a s_n_d shape
will be with
so um up it it is attractive
um and it's it's simple you yeah
fun little
uh blei eight
and uh it has yellow buttons and the all of the different kind of buttons
still it does up uh i look wise it does beautiful and uh and also compact and shape who uh who
and also he it it will be easily fitted into the hands and and you can access on the buttons easily
don't going good
graph
p_c
could it but
yeah
use to have all the buttons
cool looking like
and uh out
at the material which we are going to you was for the keys ease up plastic
and an old it which is which is a strong
um
and and also i'll for the
uh wrong
the material is plastic and our for the buttons that there's a lot of softer above
uh huh
and all that's going yeah that's a separate yeah because the local you'll be touching the buttons more solid is soft menu comes in and then um
oh for the for the lent for the light emitting diode it doesn't florescent clean up
and and it and so uh
uh
it is up bun like uh
and not in indeed
ensure nicked
and the button but in spite uh will be explained length fasting on that okay
now add there
uh uh he
we decided upon including setting features and adhere more to add these features includes and uh it's uh um signet emitting as signet it's them in a yellow immunity to um infrared date
note that if we have included this switch on and off back then
config we'll
now we have included out the feature that is the mute back ten
improve
and the site off
the mark eh
hm who didn't yet included
why don't nine bike terms
for controlling the program it's the different gender it's
uh good
we have also included too but did is flawed increasing or decreasing the boarding
can look
and the applet say included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program genders
not ordered uh module also contains of back then we discard is the mental but that what kind of button may know method menu menu in the main one one at the center
in h_t_k
we have included a back then but just florescent green got then and this is the menu that didn't which will control the color sharpness brightness
don't me
of the screen undated that big chip
they'll also included up back then
with just got as this flapping back then
no this this uh a special special feature which we have include that at this but didn't
it sent it on g_p it
shaped but dead and this is likely fix a bit
so if it gets dark the let's that light
it would take to the previous janet if if this turned towards that like ipod paper that makes chen
i think they are set to the t_v or said that makes jen so this is a
this flapping but d.
the next channel you know her name where
powder for uh no strapping as if if for example you are you are watching this taking chan that um and then you go to that then to janet and you have to go back to this again generally gets back
there's but that that okay yeah it's okay
and at the end it this similar test in did it twice recognizer
which in which will take an extra use us voice
um and then if the act according the
now none
so this is a proposed market who who now the marketing expert test do
tended
be gill
a citation if they could be celebrated about that but but but if the request effect on her
uh kit well um
one or what i really like
a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing of one thousand yes yes this can really be hold it in one it you will need two hands and it easily reachable looking for something small and yeah
yes the buttons are old raise strike
well you always and if you all didn't center very and you can even reach it over here right
so you don't have to turn it around turn it upside down to her hands over and ended up or down i really like that you really did a good job on the
mine will designers
but i've got a
uh as um
uh um nd
um i like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place sets that's a really good
yes and it sort of sticks up solo and spin really
you don't have to go first go like oh yeah you read on and it's yeah the colors for inter active
um the uh um
these buttons uh around here are very your tea
not least the front back dense is down here in that the mute buttons
on both sides the yes yes so you can push either one yes okay so if you left handed or right hand in this phase the menu up on the screen
but and this brings them in this yes yes as the orange ones
oh are are
and they're they're these these two either would think either the keys of audience
oh okay
and these to add do uh scroll the program chat and it's sort of yeah
right sorrow that was caught up in the gender uh looks done
looks like some they arc itself
including the like um no i was supposed um i have one question
uh will there be anything with non the buttons like that people know what they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what has it been have uh these patterns we'd have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons when it has some that's will have symbols that design be easy guide you don't really know is you know it doesn't have to first order because we need
symbols \'cause we're going into the international market we can have anything with one yes dependent but anyway would hide it it has to have some kind of all simple examples text or something like that i can have on the keys it's awfully that's right and imprinted on the keys of tables i just wanna make sure that and manual feature is speak we have a water for this mode which is and i stay shape
i shared shape for the snow right in the movies has no shown ask me is goes right back into his lungs right well you know i think we could do something really funny with this theory because the snail is known to be slow um
uh week uh to have some sort of little
comic affect on their marketing about how this is the rapid snail isn't the right yeah in general i would never really work
now was a one hour special features for the marketing that's really the voice recognition that's really on utilizing we'll voice recognition was their big selling point is nobody else seems to have uh in in this price range and then and then the other thing would
basically b. is cheese shape
or
practicality off use
yep
uh well oh uh i think that
everybody's goes say their remote control is practical
i think we have color to we have to do well on on a on the appearance
um
you really gui and have
the bent third
should show this to remote control on the block so i think we have to play with the image play with the snail image
uh um play with the vision will
and then the voice recognition i think those of the two things to push the lock
and the voice recognition they're gonna be are two selling points
a okay now have uh having said that i'm supposed to make room for
clash armor
well now and alice was that evaluation criteria which you know him at just have down
now we done it
token or bad financing
ha
and it in where structures i think it's always possible
took important um
um decent
no well there's a production evaluation is that you
yeah us me
but that's a v_t_s financing oh okay these are my dizzy some are you
yeah he me
h_m_m hidden
uh um
okay be head it looks and voice recognition
okay now on the financing lead bring up the um
any any looks
okay
and it's use or as we say that ps
battery you write to
that's right
how okay
more mound
so med
i guess we use one
yeah yeah if
salad china
we'll
to teams
what it did
oh on that's nice
the chunking could just change between input
h_m_m
clearly just children the all boxes
uh how can the m. i.
yep food
okay lan
uh okay and
i'm alright
uh um kinetic solar so that's in the energy source that's all we need
um
uh electronic simple chip on print is that's will be using model those
oh one
okay wow on
uh regular chip-on-print no
no that's all we need the one
case under current flat
tsk single curved double curved
oh
be um
the sense non single
po
or it is it's double kinda
double curved
one of those
case material use supplements plastic
three center i have
uh would rub per
remember because we're have the soft buttons
uh but yes but
i think are there does uh
for for them that is just for the case material so there is a special color cell be having that right
yeah neeson
and then we have the interface push but um it's
lulu
scroll wheel no indicators goal you
health c. display
wrong happen
but we didn't put the clock in it after our way
noun
uh as button supplement special collar
yep ps
special for
yes yes you do has fishy
katie
and special material rubber wood yeahs
up a
tolls seven point six whether that means
i think books there
that's the price you for
um you visits us
eight
t. eight
point two
yeah that's lines h_m_m
they point to right
so we looks like rea ah
well within budget movement kay
mm okay
information save it since it comes in
yeah
h_m_m
yep guess
i just tried yeah
nan documents document
and i mean jinx i i yes yes
yeah thing
fine
okay good so with that's the good news
you're gonna be popular
yeah who's
some can
uh um
still that uh i think financing was
pretty simple h_m_m point
now we've would like
to have a presentation brian them marketing expert on production evaluation
can help take
but file they'll see me now
k. sh grammar
and she will just to the next slide there right
you were there next slide yeah
we've k. well
uh obvious the my method for uh
uh nist
to the marketing of this thing is first test the big question will it sell
uh nd i think we should show this prototype
two people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we haven't thought uh we can't accept every suggestion of course but they we just need to get a few
and show the the prototype to can see research groups we're not want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us
that this button is toxic and um you know some charles well though and then we would sell anything so we have to get some input from most people
and then i have to i would just have to go their best intuition
uh n.
you know you like it we think it's good at
we've been get behind in selling
um neck slide please
her okay
yeah of the things that i was thinking and look for the my wish list is really really really honest in this prototype
oh and in the shape to be biomorphic i didn't want anything with angles and all square one to be comfy and realities and we got that size a small for colors brighter and more which is what we wanted
wanted feel to be a soft as possible we'll have the soft buttons um the way this is shaped even though it's gonna be hard plastic he feels good in your hand so that size
and functionality output where a stylus because people are gonna use it took what they buy
in
in c.
paradoxically the other feature is in other words the look the feel um and the shape yeah that's what people are gonna get in the store it they don't have a television store the care play with it um so they'll be a man selling points so um
dot those are been fulfilled by your prototype
yeah um go had to the next slide please
okay so on um yeah
though shape
uh um i think
is a a one go it's really really excellent shape
the sizes small
oh um
and that these points are and the importance for the for the marketing these are if in how i feel
i think that it's i think that is plenty small enough to sell but i think we're sort of right the scales one to seven i think we're sort of right in the middle as far as co other competitors
and a color i think is great colors or pride in the one in really do a great job there
and give an um the constraints that we had i think we got or the soft as possible
and then the functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality obviously we could have added
added different functions but then we just or something else so i would say that we got to have five out of seven go on functionality so i think the basic look at a great product or anything go off and running with it
uh m.
i just realize one saying yes in the finance saying there was no room for our voice recognizer
uh
the any
and uh i don't now how we can ever rather wait that or how we can include that
well
um we had what eight eight euros twenty as a call h. a. twenty yes the answer got that was about four euros to go see this band i mean maximum we have another four point three yeah and also i mean uh four thirty no um
the last see
i mean we have no way of presenting bat to all management
uh as you know as if
finish such as a finished product and saying okay we sever voice recognizer that costs so much room
so uh um me just have to
be aware of that um in and didn't know whether the four thirty will read it cover that
well as we know it today is technical technological world you can do just about anything at any price of there but the problem was quality so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us
uh and um it may not be the group is quality about it may sell it anyway
yeah yes
as we see with so many of these going to draw
utterance i i'm sorry to interrupt but i just uh make it uh i just remember that there was no um
that that was not um included in uh that that was no room for any special features even um okay
so to be we are are that
you wanna goes next slide my loading expert
we're alive it's in this my last slide i don't know
kurt
yeah signal is more muscle it um
uh um ps
um
um m.s was present the scale on the whiteboard
um and we're suppose that talk about those things team now so if you put my last slide back up there
hell
i'm sama uh
um
liao or
buying kinda
room
will because
i'd
can't remember want put long
i think my a
okay yeah uh sources see how long line wishes here
i think you can make it them the things
so
now we're all supposed to say will dave
on on we've
okay answer uh
the moan
shy
hi can handle wanna
they want you there are at one being you add and seven being the worst section
um well you've been to shape those
yeah boring okay
now and but
that's it yes having cachet piece one yeah okay uh huh yeah she missing
oh correct
then how about out
uh on the size
well it's a you'll you'll have either full or a hole or a feels just average
um
oh
i think that would give an it listed too
so okay uh
in mine
and even eighteen digits one
it's weights more
i'll or
it didn't hear the designer will be innovative
i'm
yeah i thought only ended how about how we're going on color
color uh either uh i gave it a while i really like all as far as per why i nicer commerce one one run
yeah n. one
line my okay
uh how well for fee
thanking him which uh um
consideration texture
and capture it and he nodded
uh i don't give her there too
nor try
every frame loops through the pellets three
really
for how many tilt
trel yeah okay
uh up and the rest is functionality
where are i admit i was more hard on their king
uh well it's also you can't really tried out uh uh the other things you have more is i'm more changeable so
from that point if you but um
uh give a just three
nor better
do
throat per
hard treat
it um
sort of cat it
about uh room
what slide regatta colors or
uh fashion they are you selling price or military
staff during the t_v
calculate up
it vertically
i don't really having the not delete it
no no i don't but
the uh uh on them
otherwise click we're
yeah go pool this car
anybody else have area converts or any other things it if you should evaluate
uh
here is what we looking at sea
uh satisfaction have uh on for example room for creativity
uh um
is there more room for creativity d. or are we absolutely happy
immediately obvious include these include some more buttons and links features yeah features we can meet the buttons fewer buttons more there
uh i can be add quite weak
so i think that i mean we can we can just how small buttons and more buttons neck please if we want to have
more features in nice
well that a catholic uh um
do the speech recognition again longer go there can be some buttons that are gonna be at yeah that means the recording l. uh speech leaves and so that that's where we're gonna have cheery
do you maybe table with a lot of the mute button instead of having to musically uh energy uh um yeah um
maybe we can do you something with the um
the volume control maybe you can you put that all on one button
hm
uh own room
and and room
oh don't bother
you really too
oh
consolidate some of the usage and room and see we can go
noun i will always be bearing in mind that right now we of course well within the budget them and that we still you know
we probably can't d_c
w_i_s_t this particular item we probably can't just uh
and a whole lot of more things isn't uh and
uh um we need uh
you know we need to leave space money wise ono for the uh voice recognizer
uh um
so it zip the question really is how do we feel with the project process uh
uh um are we happy whiz the creativity that has
past two euro or are we are not happy
was the new product we created hole that was created
uh i think personally i think uh i'm pretty happy i'm pretty happy with uh mean anything i think i could market yeah yeah and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership hope this project
uh my ticket delicate job easily
look look them then
uh i think teamwork ending was very very good at
the regular you you eh you want more together visiting h_m_m
a an uh i think we
are we happy vista mean we used to use
whiteboard begin use digital to digital pens of guess all these things so that we could have used the word for a cold war yeah
room yes make code to uh it's maybe not in the base position in the room
uh maybe you know like sometimes it's decision so that it's much better reasonable for everybody though and i think from that point if you read so if you can audit a little bit to the user slide because it was better position yes i think so i think absolutely and fortunate maybe all had slide presentation was made a little easier um
uh um devine you did we find no ideas i think we did live and remaining were very but i think we read it uh more than one respect or something and uh
so i think pleaded it's very well here
are the costs within budget yes yes uh is the project are elevated let's say yes yeah
uh mission in the end the celebration
oh yeah i
today we have apple juice and after we sell all my newly a level we have shape
uh
so i uh i think he old ray much um
i think this was very go attaining and uh um
i think we did come up with a new product that's uh huh feasible
visible from the production point if you infeasible former marketing point if you had
so okay
thank you own
thank you in nights
watch i i have my caught on
i always get it on my maternal yeah
as we still have to kind of go
uh you have fought
yeah it's the it's far in minutes
oh you have you have time left but we don't remember we were told we could and the final meeting at any moment i am running with all women can yeah we didn't have to fill in
l_p_c
okay then done
just one for for now
from um i
things
field
yeah or we got
do i
