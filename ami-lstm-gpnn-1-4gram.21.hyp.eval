um
one day or something
yeah
huh
oh
okay
yes yeah
and uh
oh yeah it
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh
okay good morning everybody would like you know come back at least i just start this team
um i'm just gonna have a little powerpoint presentation for us for our kickoff meeting
my name is rose longer and i'll be the project manager
um our agenda is we're gonna do a little opening and then um we'll talk little bit about the project both into acquaintance legislation which are little bit including the tool training exercise
i'm going over to the project plan too little discussion
and clusters we only have twenty five minutes
first of all our project eight um we're creating a new remote control which we have three calls about it needs to be original trendy and user friendly
i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those
um so we're gonna divide this up into three
and compact clean hearts
first the functional design which will be
um for so do individual work on the two meeting the conceptual design individual work and a meeting
and then the detailed design individual work and a meeting
so that we need to be doing our own ideas when coming together
um
collaborating
okay we're gonna get to know each other little bit
so um what we're gonna do start after
hm
let's start off with the mean um
um lima sorry only men
um we're gonna do a little tool training so we're gonna work that way for trying to uh
introduce yourself um say one thing about yourself and then try favorite animal and tell us about it
okay
uh
you know which one of these like between britney
probably not
alright so this is such a hearing what have you guys have whatsoever
but uh see introduce myself anyways okay
'kay
uh
so
well stated maybe less doing actual studies
uh well i'm happy artistic talents
how you spell your name
okay
'kay and
be
oh and i guess i'm the industrial designer
right
so see if i can get
uh
okay
well uh
terrible
uh
this is a this is jane has a favorite well it is
well
i think they're
joe
pre relational government
and he's
yeah
yeah
so what are your favorite characteristics
uh i i like having fish okay
um
'cause
quite \'cause area all around where you got um
quite decorative all animals they can so they can
they're very adaptable
they carry everything i mean without
um
i mean there is a job
actually
so you just go round table
okay oh lives in oh
uh done the user interface design
project
um
uh-huh \'cause
trying to work uh
oh i should develop the evaluation original because it might be nice to have martin c. nine
um
no commercial
what's this
results are displayed as well
somewhere around
is the world to see the man's gonna go to the
uh the other is like well this is \'cause uh
uh
well first required televisions
also the
the canisters
we don't really know much about
those those
the work
rooms
they just go
uh
oh
hi caption
hm
alright unjustly i um
around easier sort of
yeah yeah
and and uh she uh
i see this sort of field and
very helpful
yeah
really wow
oh
just
yeah
you know while
how
uh it's in the nineties uh
i know yeah however
oh
who who might go
the late supposed to use the l.
he no matter what uh i they uh we uh
uh they uh they like spread
every time
okay yeah
try to pretend like we can do about that
uh
yeah
hm
okay i'm rather so i am attaching manager
i'm from california
i mean
huge
but
see
it's definitely significantly harder when you're doing it okay
i was actually area
the same way
that's an past major
which is out
and listen to you
yeah
you both
i agree
uh
oh yeah
yes
i uh
and the red cross you can only say see how many in chinese
all the time
so i really enjoyed it
i'm just thinking and i really beautiful animals too
okay um okay moving on to
slightly more serious
'kay talk about project finances
um we have all the
and we'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro and with the profit aim of
um
fifty million euro um for our sales and because this is such this is for television that's the with market range of internet like it's an international market range we don't have to worry about specifics
um
in order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve
fifty years ago
so we're selling it for twice
what we'd like to use it for
okay \'em
just to generate a little bit discussion about the project um could i'd like to hear about your experiences using remote remote controls
um be first ideas about um creating a new
no control
what would be the best
um where you what are the features that you really like what features that you don't like
et cetera
seven
oh i hate when there's like
for every button that you have to pass to uh actually turn on the t_v like you have to do one for the power of the t_v and then like
another one to get the actual screen and then make ask about going in and out and now they keep combining
all different
remotes together and i don't know if i
necessarily like that particular trend of
to multimedia overload and just one last this year we could um
we get past some sort of like
device to help you find it out
and have used of user remote controls things like
t_v you see do you play uh
it's a video recorder
uh it's
i guess the the pretty neat little tools that you don't have to get up and walk possibly to change each other
so especially if you're someone really lazy like me either
pretty nice
um
i find them they can be a bit annoying
especially
like i know if i'm watching t_v i have
after three separate remote controls have been for me one for the t_v one for the digital box
one for the video recorder as well
um
and also they tend to
i tend to be a bit confusing to put too many buttons on them
oh
uh
to to sort of
to sort of complicated splendid
what i really wanna do is switch on and off to change the channel changeable
yeah \'em
i agree with
having too many remotes around my dad has a whole bunch more at home and remotes for various things i don't know how to work out for them
um
what's important for me i guess is that it's easy to use
and
that there's not too many buttons there not too small you know
yeah you need to and to know what you're doing
and one thing i particularly like \'s
if you're not um sort of moving it around to get it to work on infrared yeah um i think there's a way around that
but i know in my residence right now the
the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get into non so it's just simpler
just to just turn on the t_v itself and i think that's
if you're gonna make a remote control it should actually work for what it's doing
what about like batteries and things like that because there's number marks the top
don't require
like batteries or do a remote require batteries
um how to measure all them that we could
but possibly could use like a lithium battery uh i guess that would last a lot longer than double a is uh like that doesn't batteries are used in a lot of um maybe three players now in the config hm
uh
oh it's it's a little bit of conflict over \'em
yeah combining other remotes could together versus having
by different remotes
so um
like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote and yeah you don't wanna have five remotes
so how do we work with that
'cause we get something that
just has
no it doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or
program \'s other things that are not
pre hearing about
but that just has your major buttons
for that work for everything you know volume control be on off
channel changing
maybe that's specially divides it so it's like you look if you're trying to get the t_v on that's you know like the topping on the remote and nobody would be vertical original
in terms of how we're gonna make it but it's like all the t_v surface here that all p. c. as it was here all the
whatever else you programmed into it job just yet separate place and not like all the on button together and you're like i don't even know what i'm turning on the yeah
and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes
yeah
that you wouldn't need to use every day
um
okay so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on off channel changing volume another right remote with all the special things is that is one thing that on remotes tend to have buttons that the t_v still longer have as well um so like you have to have been some workers you don't need a special functions occasionally
um
but
not necessarily a hundred wouldn't a normal remote
'cause school we
designing a remote control for television only
good question
i live
the first device is just to be used for the television
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder function to
i don't know they should just stick to
just looked at every television
television related buttons on
it's a good question um
i'll look into it
let me think it's just t_v i mean if it
pretty yeah
just right that
you practice your television remote control
it's not like it
but then saying
yeah
now things might be more advanced madness
so we should
with you should assume it's it's
it's just a television remote control
whoa
we'll suppose that would be lost of of
well you record stop buttons or with the do the group as well
i don't know if it works
technological
yes i guess you have to define what
what we're aiming for
if it's just a television and then
it's a bit simpler contains less buttons that would even need to be on it
yeah
estimate the of the bands being red ball and
large
a movie of older people or people like me that are very coordinated hand i
it's really quite important that you're not pressing a small
like teeny mobile phone sized buttons
if we can help it
okay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas when if we move on
i couldn't do we
um
now next meeting starts in the units
they've actually been only working on this
this one for about twenty
so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um
but this is just a breakdown of what will be doing individually um the industrial design only meant when you're doing um
the working design
um
user interface designer that's really interesting
technical functions i guess like keeping in mind the buttons inside the buttons
i'm user requirements
um
so you'll be hearing about different trends um about different things that people need
um
i guess kind of the same discussion that we've been having moved from actual concerned consumers
okay um
and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realized in the past when we we didn't have much we just wanted to go brainstorming done um
so
pretty excited to see all your animals
and how old what wonderful um artist taylor
good
oh
any questions
well we're gonna be discussing the next meeting
you know
i haven't gotten an agenda yet um i'll put that together
i'm sure as will each get our own instruction and then um because what we're gonna do is for our individual actions and then we'll come back together
not so
sure well have more concrete things to contribute next time
she will be busy
okay um
but i thought the minutes and probably members shall be on
oh just included all that
things that we talked about
your email your slides as well
interesting
yes i please
i can't
i'll just attach it to you
in your
your number two nine two three
for a corrected
right
which is like an idiot
yeah
yeah
it
to make sure i keep checking the company website emails
the big screen there
to see if there's oh oh you can just save as and save in my documents
or just file yeah and easy access
kind and i got you a study
yeah it's a minimum
i see
twenty five percent reasons just for a semester just seem to be even less house
yeah
okay
right
yeah
yeah
um
yeah
okay
right
but see all again
this is a functional design meeting
ooh
'cause thinking
right
yeah
okay
we um we put the fashion in electronics
let's start
we had our agenda today um
just to tell you this
i see
um
when we do an opening talk about um did you get the minutes i emailed them to you i'm also putting on them in the shared folder so
yeah that's very general objectives and have your three presentations
um i'll talk about the new project requirements i just received
and then we have to make a decision on remote control functions
finally what was close
we send this meeting at back to twelve thirteen we have forty minutes so
prosodic functional design objectives
um we need to keep in mind the user requirements specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled
the actual functions design what effect the apparatus should have
and the working design
how the apparatus actually works to fulfill its function
okay two presentations \'em
you know what is going to choose
'em
should we go in or you just did it
joint please do
uh huh
alright cool
uh
yeah
'kay t_v
you might have to use the extras
oh
right
i mean
oh just
somehow
uh not so small and uh
yeah
oh i see yeah
um
i have to press function
it's actually yeah
comes in the room
h_m_ms thing
is it pointing away in your scrutiny
pound weights burden
i think each other pushing really hard
and so
oh okay
okay
huh huh
i don't know like
no
in terms thirteen million right
they get
i
so and calculators are able to get access to um the report that it's on line or from the only one with this
'kay
right
you know how to clean out of
oh
press the little presentation it's there
um political why kind of um they have a job
that
yeah right
source and talk alone about
functional requirements uh people specify when the rasta
um i guess real reaction did some market research they had a hundred subjects and their usability lab
and they watched um watch t_v and recorded the frequency that they use particular buttons and the relevant that those buttons have had
what they found was they analyze people's desires and needs
oh \'cause and their desires
um people specifically said that
he thought remotes were ugly seventy five percent of the a hundred subjects
noted that and that they are more importantly they'll eighty percent for that they would be willing to pay more
for fancy you're looking remote i don't know anything beyond what fancy means but
that's pretty really used us i think
um also
he did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inverse the related to each so younger people were more inclined to uh
want something with voice recognition whereas the older people in uh like sixty and above the segmenter so
did i really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition \'s
um people also had certain frustrations that i think that we could try to take into consideration
with
ah design that being people
um frustrated with losing their remotes
i think over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration and
people are also frustrated with the difficulty it is
to learn how to use a remote
and i think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons it just needs to be easy to use
it also mentioned something called r. s. i. announce hoping someone might you will inform me as to what are excited because i don't manage to injury
but
the buttons are still energy uh
there we go well close enough like that so i guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing people do not like that um they're part of youth i guess
'cause strain
um looking at the needs people
specify
power right now is that people's remotes are not matching the operating behavior up people are only
using ten percent of the buttons
that they have offered to them on their remote
and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume people also zap like change the channel
'bout um sixty five percent
during an hour of used
so we really need to focus in on those volumes
and channel-changer is rather then things like the audio settings and screen settings and channel settings because there is much more frequently in college complicate
what's going on
so i think that something that you might want to think about
the idea of an l. c. d. screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on
a people's preferences on that were so i don't know if that's coming to me later or some like that but something for us to consider are also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use
make sure that you know something like
no audio settings
is it is given as much importance and visibility on the remote a similar channel changing that's used a lot more often
and basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like that it has a fancy appeal and it's not ugly
and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it said do they give them any
hand injuries or
things like that
yeah
thank you very much so it was it was great
um
's move on to the next presentation
um on effects
yeah
really
i see
yeah i was gonna do
you state
yes right
yeah
me
's
ooh
and i think that's in the shared generate anyone wants to look at it
definitely
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
right so i'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control
um
need to start by considering what a remote control actually is it's uh
a device that allows us to
did you set an effects on the television
so it's basically a communication device we
which are the remote control what we want to do it sends a message to the television site
change channel change volume
uh
yeah i just these settings are just by press
um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control
first thing to do is to come up with a design specifications
we need to know what our final product is gonna be like so we need uh a clear idea of
exactly what this product does
uh how it works and what the end user is gonna want from this product
um
uh a way out suggest that we could go about this this by
designing uh somewhat different prototypes of user interfaces for this product
um and then
uh trying to get some feedback
uh \'bout
uh how well these particular prototypes work
uh so find out
what people think about
um using a remote control is is quite subjective experience
um
then different different people sort of prefer different things
um we should remember but
remote controls are uh fairly standard basic requirements when the users using a remote control
he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places so in some sense we can do it
we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional and design
uh so there were not completely shocking people
but
i think we'll end up there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh
and just to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different something that stands out
um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities
uh the first of these is this technological thing uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is
the second is is economic uh we need to find a balance between features and vice as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add advice
uh but it would also include the design of the product yeah
anyway
so i had to look on uh on the web uh to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls
n. underlies movies we can consider uh
what what things what's good about them uh what things like get by what's bad about them what's wrong with them
um how we can improve on the design still there there are found um
what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls
he's two examples uh
probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum um
and then after we've got uh
an engineering based design for a remote control so it's one that's got lots of buttons it's it's fully featured
everything you might possibly want to do is are you know it's got four backward stuff down channel numbers volume uh freeze frame
here it's it's fully featured and
yeah it might take a while to get to learn to use it but once you've learned that you speak and you can do whatever you want with your t_v
one on the right is a lot more basic it's just got the essential functions of the t_v changing the channel play stop volume
it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it but
again
it's it's wings amount about the disadvantages you can't use it
say to it
two threes television picture uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control
so we got to
to find out
find a way of striking a balance between the two
um
as i said before remote controls are subjective
different people want different things
um personally well what i want for my remote control is a device that simple is it easy to use uh it's got big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel
it it does everything that i needed to uh as i said before quite lazy i don't walk across the room just to adjust my television
another one something that that looks cool um but um the truth feels good it's ergonomically designed
okay thank you very much
yes
pretty soon
it's funny to
see the
drastic difference between those two remotes
yeah
and i thought were very pretty um
i think that could be a selling point
yeah evaluation
yes yeah thanks to assign a market for technology that looks cool yeah yeah i guess that's why companies don't happen
well you know
progress
i i really can't see wanting to sell some
even there it is
oh
sure
already
and so we did a bunch of montana is that just product that you
so uh that was just on the hand written because i think
you know when we grew up to be beautiful
uh i um
no how do i plan to go
um there is right about wrong
there are three d. if it's weight bottom
and there are three icons and it's the one that looks like it that scare them
really okay
so this is our working design presentation um i had a bit of some issues with this
because
i was able to find everything i needed but i guess that's there were still in early stages
'em
so yeah this is this is the this
the thing about working design is the
what we're trying to do is the working design as figure out how the operator apparatus can fulfill its function
um
one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder
it works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans
and then you put the beam through a filter
and that filter so
and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of
electrical energy and then other things that are brought in to make it work
i don't know if i'm explaining that very well but i like it because
so the method that it's
um working design as to figure out what you need to make it fulfill this practical function
what what needs to be done and how do we convert all means to make that time
so
well the easiest thing to do is to break down
all the points
at which you need something to happen
to make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted
true towards \'cause practical function
then i think the easiest thing to do is gonna be working on each task separately
so
um
when you press the edges that
so the findings that i got uh very just very briefly is that
you have a choice
of
the way that the
information is projected to the receiver and
in my opinion infrared is the best way to do that \'cause you don't need a sideline
so that's one thing i gonna work on
um the user interface is critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happens through the chip
that controls that converts the electrical energy into data
which then goes through the infrared so
there is the chip that uh i think ian is designing it's gonna be
crucial
and it really it all comes down to the to the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design
so the components that we find here are the energy source you know the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip
which converts the data the user that's controlling the chip and and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
yeah four main components
and
they
our designs are sort of like this you have your energy source right there
which
'kay end
'em
brings
energy or information to the chip
which
is also controlled by the user so you have to
energy going to the user who's controlling the chapel
number one is true
uh
uh huh
um you use that thing and you can go
yeah
previous previous
sorry about that
pardon
oh
no no no no
okay okay let's just get back to my schematic here
double
do the right with the lieutenant who man
i think it's a person
here
too much and you know
if you do
yeah where are you sorry
as i'm kind of pathetic things like this
um
right
so you have your energy source your user interface use controlling the chip
the chip also uses the energy
and the chip
through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infrared bulb
which will then bring the dad out to the receiver
so hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of gambled away
this is the
the parts of the working design they need to be figured out
and
personal preferences besides the fact that i can't spell we need a long lasting energy source people don't want to be changing it a lot
we need a chip
that works well with the user interface that isn't too complicated
yeah straightforward interface likely unless saying simple or not
overwhelming it with
information and we need a reliable and clear infrared signal
so that you're not leaving your remote around then having to get frustrated and go do it by hand
that's pretty much it for the working design
unix groups
and just
okay
sensitive
he he yes absolutely
oh
yeah
yeah
right
a given totally true sleeves yeah
my t_vs you're ready to be ready
yeah
i don't know
exactly
left you received regulatory
right
not looking through through this
yeah
um
for about every time
yeah
it is a good deal
oh
oh
okay
moving nothing on my screen
who we are
well you see yeah that's
okay requirements we have a couple new requirements i'll just e-mail right before the meeting and then we have to keep in in um in minors or craziness
we bring it up get around on the meetings are far but
we're not gonna work with teletext because um
we did that's been taken everybody interest we're not gonna worry about um
not to worry about that months topic types
um
it's a british thing
oh you don't notice it no no you can do what you can explain it
oh
you know it's like uh
span is kind of similar to very very basic web browser um
you know
my you have uh numbers in your remote control
um already
and you type in the page number you want
so like you type a hundred on your remote control then this this kind of
index opinions
on the television screen just in some text and some very rocket can graphics on there
and you just type numbers to go to different pages and pitch information oh mostly rather boring stuff like what's on t_v next and
prices
lottery numbers and sports cause you
useful but if you see the t_v saying like go to page one sixty on c. facts now that's what they're talking about
so it's pretty old technology so
he wanted to practice one form i have no idea why we don't have
oh okay good
you still
okay um well we're not going there
yeah man decided we're not gonna work with that
um
okay um and we also get the like your question earlier on whether there's going to be to for television video or it et cetera just for television
that over tax time
um otherwise becomes too complex or why get this out um very quickly
we'll never
short \'em at a time
um and finally at this marketing i think um our corporate image has to be recognizable
so while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our color and our slogan in the in the new design
so what's our corporate image like is this kind of yellow color which oh
hopefully put functional emailing asking we have that the emphasis on the horrors in switchboard and wall
you
but it's here we put the
'em
passionately
electronics so they can keep that in that in mind
so we want something that looks good
yeah
yeah and it's yellow
yeah or it had that maybe some buttons could be yellow like we can we can play around with a little bit
uh \'em
okay we need to talk about our functions and our target group
we decide who our target group is your um your analysis of different market um of the marketing um you identified that different groups one and different things or had certain preferences for example that um
that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition my younger people did
um
and so
who are we in this that
if we're gonna say that function uh fashion we put the fashion in electronics then you
automatically i think
the younger group
that that's who's gonna be attracted to this
yes i think was gonna have the money to buy it
that's
you know
it's gonna be twenty five euro remember so um
it has to be of marketable to um
whoever it is
hm
is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes with the television \'cause that would affect the way we market
well right now what we're doing is um deciding on
just the remote itself
so it will probably be sold separately
but \'kay twenty five
you're by itself
the only breeds on that i was given in terms of age was the voice activation um basically there's a big jump
after thirty so people don't really care pathway so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five there
yeah i think that that's a good idea i dunno maybe given any other numbers working um in terms of each later but
if that's sort of the only quality that we have but
it's a violent age and we would wanna stick between fifty and thirty five range
that's probably uh population quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway so
yeah that might be a fairly good target group for us
no those are that's all specific for speech recognition are we gonna use that as whatever functions
um
um
i i would say no because it's gonna have too much to replace
especially if we are marketing it as a selling product people are gonna be paying
uh
but god we've got a price limit of
was it twelve twelve and half euros interpretive situated easiest and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into button you twelve and a half euros without having to make too many other compromises
what also we gonna put i mean not that but i'm really going how about it i don't know what else you can
put a remote to make it technologically advanced verbs like other than just me yeah look out how is it i mean it can you look really great and some of the thing up and um buttons um i don't know when gonna buy a new remote
well why are we
why are we aiming for technological advancement everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean um
more technology i think pages in mind you could
i mean
not
if
they might be overwhelmed with
with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
someone's looking to buy a new remote don't they want like an upgrade and um now
upgraded a well we can look for look and look at upgrade or we can locate um user-friendly
yeah simplification
they could have across the remote thinking with their t_v that's just
in house bunnies
or maybe a para choir maybe they're just missing it
um
and we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have
the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or you might do it i think it's a complicated uh
which i had something to explain it like it was just a simple either that's where this way that had like the mean ones and then you could pull something out kind of it might be that the rest of the buttons but there are something like when
did you say the word global controls look good
like some t_vs they have a sort of
uh sliding screen on the remote control but no it's overcomplicate buttons oh so if you wanna do something complicated slide
program your television or which units and you
you open up the slope or show slow speed on those who was push-buttons and like people who don't wanna ever look at that and never even have to speak um and if you get the instruction manual icons at the end you just don't even read the non never even know that those things can pull out you know you're happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes one as the easy ones among us
not not we'll get one is it all still on monday
um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information
yeah
but um that's gonna be
mostly technologically
um
okay um so what what are we emphasizing
right when in this city
simplicity and functions and simplicity and fashion
okay those are very good goals i think um that we have to keep in mind it with everything we do
simplicity and fashion and
yeah or usability d_s_ps
um
how do you wanna say that which includes um emphasis on making the infrared very functional has made you don't have to travel around a lot
yeah
what can you do there
make them for a more functionally why would it not be
something i think it's a lot like to do with battery
but that's just my the battery and that i think that the chip
takes the data and presents it while without sort of scattering
yeah
so just the quality of the job
yeah
i think so
um
the quality of the quality of all the components really i mean
we can't really do anything
shining work \'cause
can be visible down the line
so our target group
we're saying fifteen or thirty five
well i don't know i use with numbers if we're not doing this
voice recognition yeah which i kind of i kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control um uh like it might be necessary for a t_v enough for the kids because bluetooth is pretty hard to
yeah yeah and it might be too expensive
i the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you low weight like you needed like you would you you just talk to you to do it
yeah probably
ultimately lazy people
i'm not going to do with predictive remote
yeah
yeah
maybe i mean if i get more numbers i'll email you before the next meeting in terms of each of those
but this doesn't divide up anything and it was only a hundred subjects also too which is um
i mean
really is not representative especially that hundreds up to date and can subdivide into each group that means that very few and each each group so
you're not there
regardless where you're aiming for the under sixty five or something
under sixty five okay that's a good start
um
i'd say where am i can we narrowed it down to maybe a um
teenagers and families
'cause that would go on to like fifty nationals or something
do you like fifty i mean
oh
it's it's hard to scenery and figure out right now
i think the product appeals cross are quite a broad range of really easy i mean we we said simplicity is is one of the features so it's going to
appeal to people
maybe people have problems with technology you know people will get us out by having lots of buttons and that might be older people
but then we've also got function which is something that definitely appeals to younger people
i mean we don't about define a target group either demographic or be in we define it by like the demographic uh
like conduct how much money they have to spend or something like that and basically what is the answer is available in the television
to like always have a bottle like that type of thing
um
so maybe it's more useful to just to just find objectives like fashion simplicity been defined specific
target group
as far as ages
because yeah things all different will appeal to different people
okay
um well there are couple functions
do we want something to that do we want
some kind of the thing to find it if it's lost
um yeah like a button on the t_v you can press another right or something i don't know like a beep
i mean i guess there were four fifty percent um of the v_a_d like frustration from from have that was the biggest one and
peoples that that happened to me i mentioned that before we knew about it
and if we're talking about making me easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing uh
sort of a day and would be relevant like the overall calling back yes no
'kay good
okay we have to uh we have about four minutes left to define our functions so let's do that quickly
and so we want something to keep it from getting lost
yeah
and
wind
um
we want large buttons for the essential things
yeah
yeah large accessible buttons for the essentials
we want a possibility to um to get
um
possibility to guide uh extra functions
hm
yeah
which are kind of hidden away in some way
oh no he didn't but uh
but not as prominent as the main features
um
um yeah
anyway
and we also will
we want it to be fashionable
which i'm not sure about the functions so much as a
uh huh
yeah
so anything on the coffee table it's not like names or anything
yeah
okay do it any other essential functions that we need
battery
do we need a long life battery guys
yeah man that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really
well things never happen to read about yeah
we should maybe investigate properties about
true too
i suspect that
what control goes with the book
yeah i would imagine it just \'cause it is an electronic device that um it
i think it does i don't i don't think of a way can operate a chip and convert that much data window
the one with element but you will maybe have it in a little tracking station like a mobile phone
really cool a cradle for your ipod
yeah those as possible
could maybe do that instead
so you don't mean you are like a rechargeable battery
but no that might contribute to less people losing it to have to do that
stays one place
um
and to think about \'em space in their rooms to like
yeah \'cause them i mean would you put on the t_v or not
steak okay that's a that's a good idea will keep it
yeah that's a soft number yeah
with the phone
okay
'em
yeah we're gonna conclude now what does everyone said
the functions of \'kay
um after the meeting we're gonna each complete disks um questionnaire and summarize the summary
i don't know it's summarization
um and then we'll have a lunch break
after that we have thirty minutes of individual work
um how much of a problem minutes in the project documentation is included with powerpoint slides everyone can do that as well but the great
um each individual actions i mean
'em
i d. industrial design if you components concept
user interface the user interface concept
my trend were watching
and as
as last time you get specific you had instructions from your personal coach emailed to you
and hopefully help next so you'll be able to access more of the website that they seem to tell you that you could
yeah it's been frustrating but
um
you sort of know any frustrations or any um
issues that come up in your um
emu or
'em
'cause summaries
'kay
sounds good
tree-view
and you got to
'kay
did you um we will have like three years in a group for
yes i just did that
hopefully it is dead people
yep
yeah
looks like there are um
looks like the second one kind of of mine
yeah that's that that i do it from like an earlier project i think so
okay
um
whereas \'bout
your arms under the shared folder hundred it might not even be new so in there we have a technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements
always
yeah i only have three i just have a card for yeah
yeah that's what i have this one of those so
you don't have might
no but that's good i think you're silly now
separately that's uh server
's
just yeah
um
but development and then say the
probably there
arena and you can't sit there
okay
i'll figure that out in the meantime
okay ah
'kay
um
yes
yeah you got actually a small dimensions
i'm gonna try this also
so while i was
i just
'cause up
screen
if you had a function f. eight again it's has the same \'cause so
first time we had it
this this second time viewed again
it'll turn it off here
computer
and i know there you hear news can be fine
if you do it again
yeah go back to just being on your computer
then another triangle the above so if you can't
if you had any ties to exactly
i guess
yeah
yeah
yeah
fourteen months
yeah it's you know how we can um
so conceptual design meeting
uh and it started approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again
i'm so we'll go just after three o'clock
um
okay
our agenda we're gonna do it opening a minute review the minutes of the last meeting then we'll have your three presentations
um and then we have to make a decision on the remote control concepts
final close
opening
are these are are minutes from the functional design
we side our target group it is that hackers on who can afford it because we have international appeal um said it's for all age groups of different um functions of that
i mean objectives for simplicity and fashion
and um in specific functions or something to keep the remote from getting lost
large buttons for the essential functions
a possibility for extra functions like a sliding
deciding peace
and a long life battery or a charging station
okay now three presentations i'd like to do it in this order first to the conceptual specification of components properties and materials
could be
um and the conceptual specification of user interface
and then they trend watching
alright \'s
oh
hm
function f. eight it
okay
right
oh
um i'm very excited by
this one actually guys i had had a lot of fun
doing it components design
this is where you look at
what does it take to make a remote control and what should be make our specific remote control about uh
'em
so we need to examine each element separately but we're designing a full thing so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole
the main elements of remote controls in general and therefore as as well of the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip
and the battery
these are all things that we had sort of addressed before but
you know take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made and what they should look like
the case uh the options that i got from head quarters about what we can do um there's there's a shape
uh the case we could do a flash a flat case the curved case or maybe even a double double curved case
i haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet just keep that in mind that these are the options that we have for manufacturing
and we can make a case out of
plastic the the main base with plastic but we have all these sort of fashion
in technological elements we can handle the word latex titanium rubber or other color \'cause types of plastic
that would be a case
um buttons the buttons we have um
push buttons which is what
real reaction uses the most often but we also have the scroll scroll wheels which can have integrated push buttons for we could go all high-tech and have an l. l. c. d. screen
um circuit board and chip they could have a simple one a regular one or an advanced one depending on what are other needs are
and then the boundary i think is where things get most exciting we're talking about long life batteries here only hit we can have you sort of basic double a batteries but we also have these options of um
using the kinetic battery like are used in high-tech watches when you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up
um so simple movements like pushing buttons with recharge the battery
or solar battery although there are slight
'em
complications with solar battery says and we can't use a latex case
if we have a solar battery
or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in the
torches from about fifty years ago flashlights
not quite sure what that is but that's the description that i receive so that's what i passing on to you
so those are options
um
the personal preferences that i was thinking
true
here's what
we've been talking \'bout all through fashion and simplicity
so if we're going for fashion in our case is i think that what we're gonna wanna look at is
a curved or a double curved case
probably with a variety of design elements maybe titanium maybe some word we're gonna have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual materials
that's sort of what i have in mind and we wanna go for simplicity
probably push-buttons but i'm sure i'm intrigued by the idea of the scroll
scroll wheel if anyone has anything
any ideas on that i mean i know the ipods and things right now have touch scroll
um
buttons which are exactly like what they're describing so that might be something we wanna look into
and i'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery
a solar i don't think would be such a good idea because how often
are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light
but this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and a simple machine around and make it work
i think that that would be a very interesting thing
but
i think we also wanna go for a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down um we really only need a regular advanced chip if we're gonna start using an l. c. d.
so i think we want
to be aware of not making things bold really
technological if they don't need to be \'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down
that's what i have for options um i appreciate anyone's important but that's what i'm seeing for the future of the
look at this thing
it's double curved like would that be like to here yeah it's kind of thing
i'm not sure i haven't received any specific
visual so imagine like
double curved is like
you know too so that
cousins and i'm sort of over just be like
single over college come with yeah and now i'm not sure but i'll let you know as soon as i get any pictures
um
yeah would you
i know if we do have a double curved case it can't have any titanium in it
but the titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space program
so that could be quite interesting space each remote
yeah
it's just all this'd just read marketing into the element
that's that's all i have to do ads
i hope i didn't go through that too quickly
i'm just a broker question um
the weight of these different elements
and you know i i do no idea
um
i'm assuming
that \'s
a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight you and that add to titanium is very like i know who but it is uses that's really basic
me
that's all i have gotten so far too
oh
any other questions
i think so yeah
we can say this in the uh shared projects if anyone wants to look the thing that has considerable notes on the topic as well if anyone needs any more information
oh
um if you may do it yourself you can put those on or um
and to me there
oh i knew both in a way but if anyone has a specific questions don't hesitate to email me or something
right
'cause like
you know where um conceptual concepts of user interface
hm
animals and so much time in the eye
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
right
right
i just
yeah
uh so i'm gonna there's gonna be
the concept of the user interface this to this device
um we've talked about this uh
the two essential properties of the user interface we want it to be simple
and we want it to be fashionable
um
uh huh
we've also got to remember this is the device itself is useful purpose uh remote people to be able to use it as a remote control
so we need to determine what the essential functions but
of the device uh and make sure but
really includes
so we've included all the various things that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people
we have a number of different choices for a design construct
um and start start something that there are actually some examples of
um
but
essentially we need to choose
how how is this device going to work how how
what kind of model this are going to be for user interaction with this device
oh once we've chosen the uh uh concept for its we can um
design the features of and the concepts making sure that we get
all the essential functions in the device and ones
uh the extra functions uh the more advanced features
and of course we also have to make it look cool
so basically that's what we don't want
we don't want lots of buttons or complicated features we want something that looks nice and simple
here's a and a fairly simple device this is a comply point from apple um
i think the main thing tonight is about it is it just has four buttons it's very minimalist tickets design
uh uses four buttons too
to move around a range of settings on the small l. c. d. screen
um
the figure i like about this is it
it's very very quick
to access the main features i can just about make up
uh but it's the bottom three buttons are uh
uh previous track next track i play pause
but the main
the main features of you about the things you use all over time
um
but if you want to do anything more advanced you don't have a little menu on the l. c. d. screen and use the buttons just to scroll around and find more advanced which is what
so i think that's that's a good
i could kind of model that we could have
um
here's uh another example this is uh
it's an interesting idea and \'s i think it it looks pretty cool
um it's certainly gotten a multi value
uh it's nice and colorful and it's nice and bites
uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around the buttons there are different shapes and then you can sort of
yeah if you're watching t_v in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons which
and basically yeah it's it's it's fun
so i i like i like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often
so it needs
a few buttons to select your favorite channels i mean most people when they watch t_v
if i have two hundred fifty channels on the t_v and then watch it
for for the most
so you don't buttons for your favorite channel changing the volume which is something you do over time when you're watching t_v
and the button to switch it off \'cause you get bored
um the other features things like adjusting the brightness tune in the t_v
uh
i don't know how else you derivative it
um
but these are
these are all necessary functions uh you can't have it
there's no point having a television but you can't you know you can't see the contrast
so we need to find a way of including these somehow
um the uh one of the suggestions that mike is to him
is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
so we would even have a small l. c. d. display on the device itself
or uh have a just a menu display that comes up on your television set can be controlled through the device under the light to access access the advanced features
uh it was keeping a very small and simple set of buttons
for all the features that you use most often
okay so you'd be advocating an l. c. d. then
i don't
that's one way to go yes
yeah i mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you
if you have an l. c. d. display it's it's nice because it's
it lets you just sit down and then control your television for your lunch or anything
there are disadvantages and and l. c. d. display would have to be quite yeah \'cause ways
right with
so
what would i assume we're gonna be making quite a device
um
it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting is it because it depends watch t_v in the dark yeah you need to be able to see how the the l. c. d. display
the alternative is to have uh
no screen display on your television but you control any control
a bit like a bit like a they have these um digital boxes where you you press buttons and it comes up with your
this thing to watch out once on each channel i mean not that's also a good idea
it it can it does have its problems as well if you've got a small t. v. and you're sitting on the other side we started with teletext comes out
hm
uh but that's a that's a design
decision that we can make
i do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seen and then you can see what's going on
um
and so
like favorite channels is is applicable but i think that you do need to have some kind of function work
it's
um you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it i don't like i know i using it as a performer he was saying well if it if it was a lot else die on the on the remote i don't know that you could from yeah you'd be able to see it i think we're talking menu
like
contrast and color tuning maybe c. or something if i understood you
yeah there are the double enhancement source yes
okay
but it is just some experiment minus and if we put a display on the remote control
good uh communication is one way sorry
you can't have a television send information back to work and to look at least i don't think you can
yeah
yeah
oh okay
no language market
okay
yeah
oh
okay on \'kay
um h. o. o.
function you work
oh yeah
ooh
right
whatever
if you press five eight
just passed on my back
uh-huh
well then all of this can be
anything so
i think
um those number two
oh really
okay
yeah
okay so we're gonna look a little bit trend watching
is the u_s getting um an executive summary that was
uh mark investigation on remote controls that was recently connected
and then also some fashion-watchers in paris and milan who comments on some things that are gonna be going on this year
so first um they have people that they trained on the important aspects of the remote controls
and right now they're saying that currently there is a functional look-and-feel
preference but that believe over the next year it's that's gonna be switching to uh
fancy look-and-feel remotes so that just goes back to uh
the whole desire uh for our real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and
so even though we're stressing more shocking moment talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea uh
they're sort of money has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look-and-feel and as these are range
the top one is double the important to the second one which is doubly important to the third one so
just to take that week into account
the second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovation that would be like if we use something like this based material uh
l. c. d. screen things like that and then easy to use was the third most important but so
really matter what we need to focus the most on fancy look-and-feel according to us
i'm getting
yeah and
action march
talks about that this year's type trend for clothes shoes are pretty cheap
it is it's
yeah
that there's a preference varies by t_v
type material
and so that brings us to my personal habit is
who wants a spongy remote for what you are not sure about
yeah
i think that i
one thing that's gonna go on
at work goes stale they just use the phone
um in the year so
even though this is coming from as a as you know trendwatch market research
i don't know how much everybody left there really
wanna take away also considering that the research has been carried out by real reaction i'm a little
hesitant as to uh
like
how all these questions may have been worded if necessarily this whole fashion into technology you to ease of use is necessarily the right drinking
personally like i might reverse it but
if we're working for this company i guess no matter what we have to stress fashion the most
it's necessarily need to be a spongy material
yeah but there's all kinds of school for education in that window
yeah
have a lot of nodes to share if you want then that pretty much some of the of
so we have
he really
see questions for the
yeah uh when can i
possibly combining them
um do you have any ideas head
possibly use these
um but how to use a fruit vegetable around
or the spongy material at all
okay
could we make is like could we make a spongy remote it would be easier titanium tasks
if it's latex see it's kind of
i'm really going to have to find a way to protect like the chip and allow um
in in
i my understanding of the latex cases that it's in fact hard to protect
step inside but it's not covered with the latex which is spongy and soft or on your hands
it's there's something to be said i mean we we got that
i mean earlier from you about um not wanting it to
ah ah repetitive stress injury to um things in in
yeah yeah so something instead of it'll be yeah great and then you want a great memory then like easy sinking into this yet i think and envisioning more like yeah
you know the material that you had when you said that like a bicycle really doesn't hurt
yeah you have one hundred i'm imagining that sort of thing and i but uh i think it's gone
given the list of materials uh this forwarded it that seems doable
could we go into fruit and vegetable colors you could color kurdish or maybe like
um
couple main ones being like an alignment or striving
right
the the buttons could be fleeting that way
is it supposed to be shift work approach
oh
i don't like it or carrots or something
workspace period shays big link areas there
converting the buttons could be set large button that's so that's the yeah
what is it like a round remote instead of like a vertical up and down on like problems but it's right
'cause kinds of
she group
yeah
yeah
like i don't know but i think you'll be able to hold it \'cause i think the reason the boundaries are uh
but it button
i think
because it depends when you when you use a remote
you press the buttons with your combination
yeah moving to um
i usually order one and maybe
or maybe you want something that shaped like a mobile phone or
so you you order them once you press about the buttons actually very side tended to
yeah just just um sometimes i'm
but i mean in order to get to all of them you know yeah they have to be within a certain amount of you've only got mode
four five buttons anyway so it's it's not this much
it when i'm when i'm pressing buttons one way i like that so i do it hold it in
yes the order in one hand yeah and you press
you press the buttons yeah and we can use
my thumb and pointer finger on the touch of it
right about the eye opener
we are like i um
is the the button on an ipod is it what is it is it just four buttons or is it implied
well there's one available here
with i mean each version of it has been a little bit different
the one i have doesn't have
there for a new like uh yeah you have one of the in between lines when they were doing that anymore
when you press the center button that's that there won't be so much fun
oh okay this one is going to add down there
yeah
anyway the good for us is \'cause like you could have the same we'll sort of factor for
like
channel flipping and then the other line could be like for volume like just the idea of like both
so few buttons for main things but then i go back many oh
and like
i don't know if we would want it on the screen there
and the actual t_v i kind of \'em wanting to say on the t_v \'cause
if you're changing the brightness and you wanna see it happening to you
and
and it still has a real screen might be
good in
theory but not as useful we do this in practice
yeah well certainly i \'cause you would be looking down at the other cities like copy t_v and then people don't wanna do that
okay um
we have about fifteen minutes left so i'm i'm in it
continue with manfred presentation um and one more slide before we close but it outside is when we need to make decisions buttons these kinds of things so i'll just bring up
'kay
sure you'll
well we we
how \'em
any more information on fruits and vegetables
not much
yeah
changeable covers like for your mobile
in different fruit vegetable colors yeah
yeah
it is but yeah and then they pick the covers could be spongy latex
whereas but the actual model could be taking you if you could
could be with you
how are probably affected oh
there's a reason
the the packaging
it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel
so instead of opening the box you just kind of feel it remote control
i'm a little bit the bullet like that i can do this
i think was so overcome
for \'em
the way it all comes out
um
oh it's
okay \'em components concept
energy
sure oh oh yes
right i had sort of skipped over that hoping you wouldn't get
be necessary but
um this is it this is the agenda they gave me so he just a slovak
decisions like the
'kay to sit
this is going to agree on
that's based on the battery you uh
what do people do
yes
kinetic battery right yeah i think there are some anyway it's really cool
yeah
yeah i mean
okay
totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change that it's
yeah
you know i think is good is as long as we consider the the cost to uh
how reliable is
programs have really gotten any is good
'cause yeah any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
but
'em
but over time but if we're using any
uh cheaper chip they leave it out i think
um circuit boards
yeah um yeah i do bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced there there's been fiberglass with copper wires attached onto them
and i think they're quite easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print is when the machine prints on the wires and solder it all together for us
i don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions i wasn't really given any options i was just given that this is how they're done
okay
'em
yeah i can't i can't really tell you i can i can tell you a lot about how it works
but i don't know any decisions \'em
if they're if they're really options off
and say looking for circuit boards and putting options and
his family
understand
um okay they've called move on to the case
um oh but i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple a regular an advanced chip okay here's the here's the thing on the chip set uh
that i got um
simple regular advanced chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor so we don't have to worry about that
um
'kay the push-button
if we're gonna have push-buttons they require a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and an l. c. d. requires advanced
do we wanna scroll wheel or do we just want push buttons
um
i don't think women really need disk
it will i mean it might be nice for changing the volume
it'll be nice for changing the volume but i don't know how useful would be for changing the channel because you don't have control over numbers are you are you really need buttons is neutral
it be handy for going through it
if there was an on a menu of your channel choices
when you can scroll you could scroll through the channels
and then the volume would just light minutes left for the meeting and the volume or just be like the same way
yeah foreign backgrounds
i'm just thinking like it would make it much like speaker
sort of looking
yeah
and otherwise no matter how many buttons we have or have like you know black with red sitting down there no it's gonna never really sort of start looking like
you know it's gonna sound like we want something uh stacked up
um
so
have a scroll for volume
or for all the secret functions
when you get on the on screen menu of all your functions that your remote
could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus
i think you know i think the scroll wheel would be nice but it's not necessary
right
so we could either go with a simple a regular chip depending now maybe we could table others um for later
uh huh
i think well i think when we're going to be the user phase we're gonna have to decide the interface we have to decide um
whether i have a scroll or not well let's think about that well we talk about case against a case uh i'm kinda like in the idea of latex
if if spongy is the in thing
i'm a little um i'm more hesitant about it because i'm worried about protecting stuff on the inside
okay
um could be horrible and then attack or everything that i would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone whatever kind of thing what i've seen
just not related to this but of latex cases before is that
there's a like a hard plastic
inside it just cover it with a latex okay not too thick layer matrix just enough to be cripple
like like candles or or anything that you've seen like that
the inside is hard
i don't think we need to worry \'bout
protecting the circuit board i think that that's time for us okay
so we it we do want latex
yeah
okay
text uh
probably in colors maybe fruity vegetable colors
yeah
pretty galleries
okay um let's go to the of user interface then we'll get back to the
chavez's
oh and we want a curved case yeah
or double curved \'s
well we don't really with the differences right i'm thinking curtis i'm sorry yeah
yeah yeah okay
we don't really know what the difference
um
'kay interface the type and the supplements
so
pushable or scroll
right
you know
um
and i think if we wanna keep our costs um we should just go for push-buttons
'cause then we can have uh a simple chip
uh it's
it's simply it's it's cheaper to make push-buttons and that is the school doesn't get us in terms of the
in terms of
economics it's probably better to
and if we had a screen on screen um
kind of thing that you could scroll through like you can use the buttons to scroll through the years
you know it's
i think it is fairly simple
for channel surfing i think the scroll an actual like an ipod kind of scroll thing would be too fast
yeah
i see
push buttons at least unless we get any information i have no idea how much more expensive the scroll wheel is then
and push-button but it's gotta be some more expensive so
no i think it might be better to
put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cookies too
yeah
is it is it is you do you feel yeah and lets like see fig anything else i mean i'm not
records all of the scroll wheel it's more just to give it a different kind of look but is it gonna be a latex
click thing that's gonna look cool um
that's quite a bigger impact on school room
yeah
okay so we're gonna go with um
type
push-buttons
yeah
and then supplements how we're gonna do that
oh what you mean by supplements
um
i assume that's what else we're gonna like have the um like the additional buttons we can use
um so we have like a menu button
yep so that we can access on screen things
you know
then okay um so we're doing it on screen menu so they don't score or buttons gonna be hard enough
on-off uh volume
favorite channels
oh so like when you're wherever you go
you may you tapes or is that you you lower your remote you results
um
reset channels
and then we're gonna need \'em numbers
one two zero
oh we wouldn't even the numbers
i think maybe numbers seems to this kind of old energy he said it
check i guess \'cause tone it down
yeah when you know you can just do the scrolling i need some kind of
i don't know so up-down kind of button yeah the volume control type of remote
for example
yeah
okay now i'm on finishing the meeting now um the identity exactly thirty minutes um you need to have things to do look-and-feel design and user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modeling clay
yeah yeah
so is the training
you know basically um do we said on the chip let's go with a simple just able to yeah
yeah and and it'll take you everywhere
uh i think these are in our shared folder okay cool
heh
for a kid
i wasn't expecting that
good
oh okay
yeah
right
okay
oh
oh
hm
okay
okay
okay um
well control our detailed design meeting
in pretty
he started
yeah
approximately fifty forty or something
okay
okay
uh the agenda that we're gonna do lip opening and then
um i'll
ten minutes from last meeting what we did just fast
um
the we'll have the prototype presentation an in depth look at the evaluation criteria
well the finances
and finally i do production evaluation and close
so starting off with \'em blasts
the last one i down here
um but we talked about energy we're gonna use a kinetic battery
um we want to use a simple chip because we're not gonna need a shuffle \'em
you can either scroll
um which is in a latex case
with fruity colors it's curved
and
um we're using push-buttons
and with this segment of the on screen menu
so it sounded like we had said um
like either nine buttons
including five percent chips
okay
let's do the look-and-feel design presentation first
but
what is that
right well we have a three different prototypes and i guess we'll start with with this one um
we have our colors not
are not fixed that this is the general shape
um it's you
sort of
yeah like
this you can't or you stretch it over and then
's easily adaptable to either hand
you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push them with your
index finger for their hands or even i mean there's a whole variety can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger
uh we have the on-off button at the chip it's very visible very big
we have ah
up and down buttons which are also gonna be our channel selectors and we have a little menu button here
if you push
if we're just pushing is not really the the menu buttons if the the volume buttons rather if you press select once they become channel changing buttons
if we press select three times in the menu with the other features
and part possibly also with here
t. v. channel choices shows up and you have your five p. sets down here
and people want
have hold of that see how it feels in your head
that's our number one prototype
um
you wanna
present the material or shall we go margin using the little labels and it will take a bit
you go out one one plus uh
the
no one box parameters on this one is known as the potato
uh it's
uh huh
how can i present it
it's an ergonomic shape
so it fits in yeah and nicely um
's designs to be used even in your left hand or or in your right hand
um i've gone i just uh just for four buttons on this one
um
two glue buttons here i for adjusting the volume second volume up
uh volume down on the other side yeah
um the right one is half for it
oh changing
channels
channel up and channel down and that's um moves between
your favorite channels that you've selected
uh this middle button it brings up the on screen menu
and money working on screen menu
use the other four buttons to navigate to a menu system
and the middle button uh to select
uh it's
that's basically what most tighter
um the on-off
uh that would be one of your channels basically satellite channels there would be
just issued station machine off yeah
could the middle button on the on screen menu function of the power button
um
what's
um don't really need it would make it hard to turn the machine off
to turn your t_v off
if you press and hold it maybe
you know you don't want to do you agree on on off
so possibility into
and then finally we have
um the martian or the parent
either way um it's a bit different
just
a little bit more of a creative field
i have the on off
talk \'ll stemma
on the top
oh
we have the five preset
see
right
yeah they have all the sides to make it a little bit more three dimensional you have your channel changing volume changing buttons and the menu button right here in the middle
so
that's for your consideration as well as plus is interesting talking wait to have standing up we figured it could stand up like this on your table if you wanted to if i read about the bottom five
so i had one of the little right uh the menu select button
very interesting this this is a favorite restaurant software prototypes um
basically in terms of making decisions what we need to do is
first of all decide on the form uh which are three different shapes to remotes then
decide what kind of button do we want how many buttons and then to choose what colors we want to make the buttons and if we want to put any text on the device like labels on the buttons or
broadband labeling
oh
an argument or whatever
we were we were thinking that
normally we go for fruity colors but maybe
we're also thinking that you should have
middle aged
man
for an example customer might not want a fruity colored remote some
maybe
we'd have one version that's a bit tone down
maybe with with less contrast on it
there's something still a little bright to make it hard to lose but
but we don't want it to look like a good story
yeah so that was one thing that we brought up over email i don't know if you picked up your email you the um the the on feature that we considered for not getting lost right well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email
and
we think that each of these are so distinctive
that it's not just like another piece of technology around her house it's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen you know so we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be
a script on channel composite and extraction since then
small
would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like i don't you
take to your
to your t_v and um that when you press it a little like b. goes off
that would be
conceptually possible
i think it would be difficult technologically in because if you only few remotes lost
it's probably on diversity
and in that case you can't be shown send an interesting \'cause signal to that
you lose so it's
i'm not quite sure that's why we haven't i wonder if it's
if it's more just a gimmick than anything else
probably not
how many times do you really
seriously lose your remote control would
would a device like that actually help you to find
there might be something that you can do in the circuit board in the chip
to make it make a noise or something but it would take a lot more development that we have this afternoon
okay
that's in their evaluation
given
um we so we don't we decided not to worry about that for now
yeah \'cause more designs are very bright so you're right they're gonna stick out
uh you said do people have a preference as far as feeling functionality
yeah i \'cause those
simple words are sort of already there so for trying to think of something
sort of like anyone fine you know this is like
well your initial i'm initially trying to do just that it's like comparable and i cannot different
i sort of like this one like i don't know why it just it's like small but still all
sort of like you looking out now
but i also like the the side buttons on our own like i think that's kind of key
but
and how much in your \'cause has to do with it
the fashion and bob
sort of cool looking
i think that we also need to focus on
could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on on both
so then we'll we'll uh we'll yeah that's good
the
yeah
sticker
that's not so good
um and why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria at most money like i think we're supposed to have one that we do it for oh okay
okay i was so small they examples to develop i mean i have to like writes on the whiteboard so
yes or just right on right now i actually don't have like uh
halfway down to make cuts
it could be done
yeah
it's kind of like a joystick or anything
that's not cool and they
maybe a little smaller than i do like it but customers
this is for two years
no it doesn't kind of like with the phone
fruits
true
thank you for for uh
yeah it could happen standpoint i could do kind of like the standard like
yeah
i don't sell to gatekeeper gripped so
'cause goes in between anger and and
just things like this one
okay it's everybody learning then this detail
i like the idea of the germans too i mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down
that one who
i am worried about like um using the menu
um
in uh it
like in within menus there submenus in so how do you get back to the main menu
what on the ipod for example you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again it brings you back one level
but that has a menu button separate from the select button whereas if this one's about the menu and the select button
this is just the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for the structure
that's right
define the choice that you want so you press the uh you press the right button
uh
could these you used for going to answer the just we're going into multimedia software is maybe it could be one of those if you press down hold
for two seconds then it brings you back one level or something you
okay well as long as we have that in mind as we're designing itself
yeah
okay so which one is sort of a clique let me have to draft
whether or not it
these are \'s
um necessities
but i tell you once thought
the potato are willing to is that the time so
okay well we doesn't change it after we go through this one so basically we video
'cause and then things that we talked about
for me to make sure that remote actually guys
conform to the things that is that is going to have so i always want to do is we each need to separately
right easy to find a canal tabulated average just to make sure
she doesn't need that also
the past time
'cause foreground
the ontology are still one sided with
one me really pseudo
and then we can
not through at all or fourth
if the remote that we created
can for us if i criteria so we can do this one first
first one i know it needs uh in the look-and-feel
um object yeah
so i can i can hang up
for japanese
yeah well i was probably somewhere else i'm with a like a
right
that's just fine
yeah
oh with that
you should go
i i kind of think it's it too you could have that i'd give it a one or so
no matter what give you a dollar there
i would give it
one
um crafted it's creative i don't know if fancy is the word that we use
i don't know if any of them are and
in
i'd say
to because i'm unique
i have to
so
what's that
alright i seems our scale for functionality is functional
i think it's true much longer though one
one
i think it is
it's functional it's also pretty basic so there too
right
um
functional
i think it'll get everything done i think it might be a little confusing
first
um
well there's no that's that's gonna be a later one that okay then i may give it a tip
oh
um i don't say this technologically indicator
did you functional
yeah she's not
um is it technologically innovative yet
ooh
not really i mean
that so much we don't have any screen we don't have
yeah they chat
other than what it looks like i don't know if it is
well the kinetic battery the battery
eight synthetic ones i'll
oh you will notice
but it but don't you definitely hear it will be like a i have never change the batteries may have like latex them against the wall obviously material
is it clippings allow teachers that are made it really
yeah
uh i won't say that
it's
yeah
like fancy versus creative it's it's
different
design innovative i dunno
i'll give it a three
oh
oh
it's it's technologically it's not
it's not unique i mean this is just
is it is it just push buttons um
so a bit of
i think it will go the four as well
oh okay
really
the battery there
next is it easy to use just a you know easier one will be separate you can't
okay
overlap them
i think it's really easy it's
all of it
that's true
oh
okay no one
pretty hard to answer
what's that one
now it's a two
right
um being as long as the if it had the spongy holiday
and if indeed it's the latex rubber right is spongy okay
for one uh
i wonder if it bounces when you drop it yeah
who then maybe her break character you it \'cause there'll be less impact we knew where you don't alter one
alright and the next is that integrates them gaussian of fruits and that is
oh about uh uh well again yeah uh oh
it might be \'cause that's a corporate color isn't it
that's right yeah corporate color we didn't keep that in
you are going to be yellow
well if we
i don't make it a little less could a little more confusing but if we had all the buttons and black and designing and the outside and yellow that'd be a corporate one and then we could also have alternative colors one or more conservative one
one is more credibility kind of way or something
yeah
we have this um and can we have like an r. r. inscribed on the bottom or something sure
kind of
right so it it really started out that skill
so it's i think it's it's kind of a no into oh i i look around and see over here that's the most rich yeah oh i know that there and number
well i'm
i had to
one battery um and the design it match that everybody remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use the channel being the volume boast
i think we really have that hot sunny one
yeah in retail
so what
using one of those
yes
okay on also we talked really about ah i fly in winds for that
um
for
our whole family
thing
we think that the latex sort of greater
appropriately take that into account
i think all the material \'cause ends you know where you are
it's gonna be hard to do
and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing that on
i mean i'm one of the best and i can't fit in the hand i don't
so
and i caught the tail
uh i'll say two as well because all the people that are used to like texting but if i'm my friend okay
you
well at first
yeah so i said to
right
uh huh
easily wearing yeah
i know you say you are a little bit are stuff that
and now it sort of reminds me of the a guy and i just got i saw read the instruction book and it okay go
and i'm not good at parenting
not really
so i'm going to go
the menu system and uh the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing but i think it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out but you'll have it afterwards
so i i think i'd give it to i guess
i think it
it's probably a little out of the mess with most of them because you have to
you have to use the menu system and you have to
tell you what your favorite channels are about could take a better remote object first thing but
once you if you want to learn how to use it
from \'cause buttons and so on group of
what is it
i think it give it a four too it's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy once you've done it but
hm
alright um
also really read something about losing ends in our math class and that at all
so
we we i think we can kind of see we just with color
okay so in terms of having it do you think that i feel
that is a seven
how easier is that
totally
um and i'm gonna give a one or something there
we can still image memory again the a year kind of background by about anywhere else gonna stay
um i z. given uh three
is it depends how
tidy word on you
give it for
okay before \'cause
it would be easy to lose small to
i gaussians the simplicity
oh how old is it
i guess just me
all
sports a user simple and design
yeah overall \'cause we've said there were two meetings or simplicity fashion so that wasn't an excitation
yeah
separate from b. n. c.
like
after that
um
yeah like once we example but it's not like totally x_m_l examples so i mean give it
i'll give it a three i guess
we'll give it to
very
oh yeah fashion well
's totally fashionable
i don't think that there are going to be doing half of any bigger i think it's very technology and fashions
oh really i i don't know i don't think it's quite especially was by robot or both
i do like that
it requires a relatively like others uh search
the fruit and little bit
number uh
so
three
'cause won
and doesn't need ah like
demographic and we saw uh for international heal
that whole thing
so it's server items
oh why not
hm
i think as long if we offer in and
in at least three different color arrangements
oh yeah yeah that's good
so given that \'til
'kay and
she
right then you have any other features that they think are important that we didn't talk about
well um we didn't
we didn't address the fact that it does need to have a corporate level silence
let's make sure we keep that in mind that we have that one of our colors concept is for bread and has an r. on it while i think all of those notion are yeah
and so we're
okay so what is it
oh okay
'kay round
oh really
okay now we're gonna look at finances um i have an excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost
um
oh okay
good and others
hm hm
okay um uh yeah i know
really
we were space
it is in the in your work
um
okay
'kay hand dynamo
we use internet batteries right in that it yeah
um i'm having one per
when \'kay
um electronics
single
simple example uh
'kay
um the case
well uh
'cause just double curved
it is different yeah it's very query so okay
yeah they get a pinch of it so i don't know enough
a case material supplements
sweet
not many plastic and
no we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is a scene bad at this time it is
the what i guess it was rubber rubber is rubber and special color
yeah
you get more than one special color
yeah we're using all this through special color these two special colors
um i don't know because it the basic color is another yeah
well we know that we're having these three higher so you're saying what are we talking about on each
color combination are we
no we'll like we'll have yellow and black
's that
two special colors
yeah i don't know or that i always wait in line regions or or
uh
i guess it's three c. three three three ever
i'm trying
maybe are are we in color as well so you know interface we do push buttons yeah but how many buttons do we have
's x.
five
oh that sucks with the power
so
anything else
no oh we'll do we'll
uh buttons in special colors machines
okay which away oh buttons oh so um
so the case material we just have one color
right
but nobody is will be in special colors or making multiple varieties of
this is why i'm getting confused
we're saying per unit
yeah are you okay so each unit will only have one color alright in each new but the two cases
could have up to three i mean the buttons could each could be up to three colors as that's how it's designed there i like i like that um
okay
special for \'em
they're all kind of just push button no i think in their mind special material you want the rubber as well probably yeah so
oh do you do per button do i
no i don't think so
i think there if there are gonna be rabbit then it that's what it matters
yeah absolutely fabulous \'cause holman case material to one yeah it's i mean it's to make a rubber duck awaits maybe
thirteen point seven
oh
yeah
what can we were gonna just have our buttons all be one color
um catholic the button is
it's already started to do with three anyway
okay uh i we should just double curved maybe it's single but i have no idea we've got
i don't know i didn't get any measures
yeah it's okay where is it
it yeah that that was not yet
okay it's a kinetic battery that's kind of expands and
but we have a simple chip single curve
case material is rubber and that special color
yeah
but that's important
this is six buttons
oh yeah sixty thousand is just teens
well it's almost thirteen and now it's fifteen
no \'kay maybe not
i don't know what just happened
for me
that's twelve
i was a target price again
top drawer and back oh someone just
so we're okay
right thinking
yeah \'cause wall
ish
okay backgrounds that
'em stay
i think that too ah um
ah
big shared folder so you know
um okay
in fact um agenda
oh
um i yeah the costs under twelve fifty euro yeah yeah yeah they are for the last the project evaluation
project process
satisfaction with for example the room for creativity leadership
teamwork the needs
any new ideas found
so i guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating
how we create it's project information we guide uh menus how we used it
if we're able to um
you know news or creativity with the information
um how old how well i guess i'm glad it's
um
the uh how well we work together as a team
um
the digital pens the whiteboard
yeah
okay
i feel very creative
'kay into it
making the prototypes
i think we've been successful in but really
to achieve
almost all of the design goals that we set ourselves to start
and we've come up with a finnish project and we just about got separated cost
i think we could have done even better with a little bit more information limits a single curved case how many colors
what the colors count
um things but given given what we had i think we did we did really well
'em
i think we worked together pretty well
yeah
yeah i never played that more
market research in industrial thing that had taken them to output the fruits of vegetables divided by creativity and i'm willing to have them the whole thing going to your screen
oh i mean
i do think though the pen little distracting for me personally
like a tapping us um
or just being so conscious of
turning the peter down
yeah the bit of a distraction
yeah
that's fine
i chose not to do a powerpoint \'cause they and it made sense to us i like that i had the option to do that and just stick my own notes within that sort of thing
yeah i think we all made um very significant contributions i don't think anybody dominated it
which i thought was really good like each of us
was able to um like if you had information i
um i try to facilitate it with that
like taking over um
yeah you can a little fish models
if there really give the current one one does it get we work at this this bangor uh
sure we have that somewhere on the packaging
i have a little trying to think of a good plan that they could add there but
i think that's a good like one single
ooh yeah there are gonna be a c_d in yes
hopefully that would just figured out
some point but
um
'cause the useful little gadget
of things that you design that has uh-huh
okay um what are the new ideas thousand
people should really base their votes literature vegetables definitely i will
or or at least we could put creative enough to think of
toggle switches to
i don't
i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now how are still evaluating them
yeah i even know they exist to any to get watches that happen like really quite expensive watches
that is never need a battery \'cause you're always interested to
but in other things i think it'd be really good
and it yeah
a task
um
okay closing
but the cost in the budget
'cause the project is evaluated
those final questionnaire and meeting summary
um
so this great products kids i think with
created something really interesting and then we have a market for it
um
especially if we can produce a twelve point three which we help
um
yeah
make sure in your question you put down
'cause systems of
well the process on um
the final results and
yeah real yeah if you like the mercenary mode which is more than one that would be my second job that w. a. second-rate out of the top toggle i'm afraid and we don't bring it reveals apparently didn't bring it it it was happening as i wanted to have it is
as as determined then
'kay
so that's funny
yeah
i guess it started as up
care that it started like you were like a bunch of whether anything when i didn't have nothing in between them
yeah
as it stands uh
um
hello
we actually bracketed some remote control comparing them
so ah oh oh oh oh well uh
but um
yeah
really
congratulations
yeah \'em
easy to see
nothing will come up and software believes posterior is relevant
yeah
um i believe
yeah
it doesn't matter classes anybody this thing like taking matters class that's only going but that's the company words yeah but check it out so like all these like blanks that are gone
you know that all you need to keep in mind your knowledge management
people actually don't
well first reduce that make it really to do the job because it's products then uh it's okay
oh it's very work relevant considered as they were out
yeah definitely
and they said that they give you links to the corporate website
oh oh very good see we did little to recover website
it's just just iteration about circuit boards
it's really oh
it's the world
it's so cool
that would like something is pretty cool yeah so that excel it's one like the program six inspiration um
basically maybe two cents or non caching blue
that kind of thing thing
um there's nothing much you yeah my inspiration from from last time this is in the interior of a remote control being taken up a bit by bit talking about circuit boards
i learned a lot actually um i could probably take apart a remote control now if i really needed to
the summer school or we have all table and everything
oh hello
circuits and chips and
trends ponders look i wrote it down because i thought it would be relevant by all the different parts of the inside of a remote control but then
three like you don't actually have this
you think i never liked it would you prefer outside his group or multifunction remote control that i didn't have like any kind of table
well something somebody else the question to further school
it's really interesting
i thought it was a little tricky having to hand \'round this
thank you
yeah yeah you need a lot of um
otherwise the technology today is kind of cool
who knows really how to get
you know m_s_n
we didn't use the whiteboard that much
no
although i don't see how
we could have
very a lot at least for me
i
it is yeah if i had gotten pictures of the different parts of the case
the different looks of the case i would probably john
you
some applicability anything i think usually like whiteboards are good
no question ideals are like
if we had like a bring they were gonna gonna brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it but now that we're going to with only four people it doesn't really
makes sense given the weather and with the powerpoint that we can all look at like you can do all those things pretty much on powerpoint
yeah
does anyone easily sell that
made us more willing to like take notes and uh
like you would appear \'cause all needed them separately kind of on the whiteboard in this room
my \'cause we're all gonna be working
in different places
yeah
it
if we're all gonna stay here all the time then having the notes up on the whiteboard
but it all right but everyone needs their own like specific notes i guess
now when you were um creating your
um projects or did you work together or did you have like do separate projects
oh bring reports over
um but we were making
what
with so many different shapes and um
discussed uh uh
how the buttons work work
you know
and \'s
how we could load improvement
with those words
that is a bit of both really are we just kind of started out by taking a color of claim
just fooling around with it and i came out with that run the shape in him and then sort of potato re
mango shape
and then select from there really
cool
'cause pun
it
'cause telegenic management i thought well managed
oh
oh really
the first group people go with things different
this represented actually
well we did a good job of marriage
from decisions against it
black scoring they don't have any other type of
and what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have ratings and then
people sort of drift away over about anything actually really been decided
we figure we don't
we do clearing and decisive
decisive points down a bit of the meetings so that we
we knew where to go one
yeah i was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we were getting
we didn't really have enough from information to make firm decisions about we're able to do it regardless so
i'm not usually a very decisive person said to have people finish
this this isn't able to
keep going
i found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes
yeah especially last term we
yeah i think the last \'em we had a lot of information
in at the same time
not quite enough
you know what i mean
we we couldn't answer every single question
um
but
and i i felt the first two meetings that i was coming in with no information in that sort of
me me you really
i don't know there in together powerpoint have no no interest again last time it was like the opposite
and so much information and so much to talk about
is interesting what came out like later like as i was doing then
when i was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um that more points came out from your presentation even
um
the little animals that we didn't do uh um
something for losing the remote
yeah that was kind of a big point of that or something like
in order to talk about that we would have had to have actual knowledge about
circuit board so that yeah it was like is it only just for creating on the
excel file that wasn't like
the option to select to
so no not included so there is no way we could do like yeah i really didn't do there's no way for us to
continued on that it was really there i think we were just getting over enthusiastic with the task
i didn't want to say really got into it i mean i got into it
as they went on i got really like who were design the remote control
professors menu button knows what
it was interesting though that they cut that fifty percent of people say they have research with losing the remote and if they didn't provide us with information to
yeah but um
yeah i remember
we should
discuss that
i feel that like people
people have like
things they can put on the keys the precedent will be yeah but i but i'm sure that would require some kind of technology that
person or what at least there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things
so you won't lose them you
i don't know i mean we were talking about it and like
in my household at least there's only about two places but the remote is ever you \'cause there's only one t_v and
there's only like three chairs keys and always two in the morning
you lose them in your pocket like usual forget that
or like put it down from a that like made sense and then
i remember there's always been so there's things
yeah
it it depends on how organized you are personally you are like current guess what the side of the house is to you
but i mean
i am not sure areas for losing like he scratching my guess up several of them
'kay when it
he's the refrigerator the other five hundred number
so it's pretty clear issues that way
and um
good good
uh the new you take yourself to the bag it for the go-there frustrated
back to my room
'kay couldn't kick it is what color i like it should
definitely in the vegetable short little bits
about you is it alleviate like overnight using a different code
um
yep
so i guess that's good we don't really care to answer that much yeah
can only take into them and
yeah maybe with a little rubber but we could happen have uh
robot alien pair or whatever he's have a little voicing
i'm located
yeah
no
i t. p. s.
put it into the deep yeah
um
no
although if it's sitting still for machine made when the block by itself can be able to get a model that you were really isn't crazy like a lecture magnet that you push it over to individually it's and it didn't look like that is just amelia
just a few it it
like you have to ever vote for your remote
let it give it didn't you
if you want but if you can attach them to the t_v and yeah
yeah
and
hm
i'm in the mountains those
just
so i'm just um
true that take minutes
insight into what you have sent to the email saying that powerpoint minutes will be complementary and then like
repeating i'm just gonna make
making full minutes so that it will include all of the agenda and i think
it seems like how
she felt like it was typing organizing to do
i didn't have like information to
's laugh
it is um
how much of your powerpoint was already done for you
every meeting noticed it
um added slides um
i added a couple slides each time that's fine
and they do anything slides \'cause
i would just get slides with titles on the new filter moment
i didn't even think about that one
well the thing was it would provide an agenda was like several points but it wouldn't be assigned for each point
uh and that's the only way i remember that i got a point
that i know personally when i do powerpoint decided you know
so i headed ones even if it was just like the title of it like the three presentations and immediately
did you tell the slogan on it okay just be like
the slogan on in our depending on
with like in durham yeah this is uh no i don't think we need to energy stored in our especially the yellow line
black one
it's a killer blow
oh yellow and blue when we go to the web pages
yeah i was just kinda going by the web because they didn't give me any
leah
like you know rate is lower
growing
great better than black doesn't have an ability
'kay time
it's just beyond like news clipping it's
finish meeting you know
was in it it just seemed that um i thought was interesting that i marked marketing
um expert do not agree with the marketing um
yeah he enjoys it is yeah exactly
well perspective you really want to actually uh
a really big market evaluation you will just have
in one set of
source kind of and they work so now i've backed up would just be a sentence like we did this survey it gives us more people than
yes
i don't know
i always do that
yes it it
sort of a grey isn't it
yellow and grey that the slogan that blue
well we got some grey and we had some little buttons we're going
yeah
well the other topic slightly
maybe it like
kind of
you know it's
well we're not
sadly going to actually produce a mess though if they ever come out
with the three of her but it but it about a corpus into words i'm gonna play the intellectual property uh
yeah
particularly the whole thing is done um until it's been that long
get sucked in
yeah
um i don't know
cindy
oh
yes
it's it's
four seconds
hi guys uh good morning oh very clear
um yeah i want to introduce myself uh many me is uh sri the prosody and uh i'm the project manager for this new project which we'll go to is too small
so i want to introduce first of all uh the names
the colleagues here
and what you're doing
i share my name and segments and i am uh
he's \'kay usability and user interface design
i z. and i do accounting
uh how you spell your name or e. d.
p. d. \'kay
do you also do marketing
so only contain
'kay electronics
right
and i'm christine and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer
the stupid side
and that everyone
so who's uh marketing over marketing is uh is me
you know
so uh asks thanks for coming for the meeting first of all
and uh
we have uh
one time just put five minutes to discuss about uh this project and uh the project initiation
first of all i want to ask the distributor about you or a marketing plan a newer product line
and uh
well i think you'll see that throughout the day and how we're going to put this together as a marketing too
to mark
product
we'll have to see
five three discussion on where we're gonna go for
yes
hm
uh but to be already have like a functional design or a technical design uh for the moment idea
at one moment not yet okay but uh what's what's your are gonna do you have some project plan
something
sure
good question
no it's like i said we have to be discussed between all of us and will go for
exactly
yeah it's a program to work out the other
okay \'cause so
oh by when you think and you can uh
give me some kind of uh project plan
'kay discussing it certainly by the next meeting
my next meeting okay that'd be great
uh
okay so there's any questions or are there still for
what uh
the \'s project
where's the goal project
uh the goal of the project i think maybe i will uh hand out to the you
it's my
the probably
but he's in the sales find the colon and the sailors also explained what to do
we have the define exactly what our product is from uh
yeah it's uh can you explain uh what exactly the book series
for what i had on mine
we're supposed to marketing coffee
'cause everett
uh i think uh i'm not phone we're making the remote control remote controls \'cause i had two different things i had the first part of mine was to make a remote control for new remote control for television
right after i had a discussion about coffee so
we'll start with the remote control for television then
so we have to design something that is very user friendly
something uh
visually has something that we will draw people to buy the product
because i think everybody's experienced with their remote controls some remote controls are hard for for throwing out the window
uh um
most of all but i don't know we have to come up with a new idea
how to make it
a lot easier to use
um
it's a lot of times
spend
half a day through the
instruction book trying to figure out how to use it
yeah yeah
and uh
what about kristin what about your uh the industrial design plan
or do
have a design already on this
product or the
you still working on the design
'em
no i i have not began working on the design
and \'em
i uh
i actually didn't know we were designing a remote control i thought we were designing a new monitor um
the
web site i went to look at
i had some announcements about an introduction of a um
uh some sort of a seven inch pound monitor
and um
i
understood that that was the project goal
so um i'm glad i didn't do any work um ahead of time because
i really didn't understand the project goal
'kay
'em
i just
i did see that we're starting a new project together and that was before member team and compares to these people
and um
that's bad ten
that's and i i read through the different steps and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps
so you will be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team
the design of for the industrial design yes
um why would they think that depends on how much money you give us
from from the movie because uh you know he can they can make it uh
yeah different choices of different financial models yeah but the before we talk about the the finance okay
uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market
and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's still individual also
well you know um i kind of think that in general you have to do uh
um i think you have to have something very fashionable
then it's a very attractive that um
people see and recognize set its goal and uh they immediately wanna have it uh
have one of their own so it would really would need to um
something like the ipod would be good seems to have caught on fairly well so
'em
you know okay what it does just so it looks cool
'kay
but uh uh when you think you can give me like uh
kind of a design of the functional design of the technical design
well i got a lot of other projects i'm doing right now
um and so i'll have to wait and see how those uh have those go if they uh go quickly and then it could be a month with um
if i run into any problems in my other projects he might be six months
yes but uh i need something in the writing so like uh what's your functional design what's your technical design
and uh how many people you need for this project and what's the time frame you're looking for yeah in the what the budget maybe uh initial particular working
okay i and uh always going to the market okay so do you have to meet with the marketing team another way to market and what are the marketing strategy plan
okay when are you going to introduce okay and by the time introduced a product a day not that that would be a competition okay so i need some kind of uh
well
the
plan in the writing from you
'kay
any logical thing
yeah as soon as possible
i have one
if uh
if we have enough time uh
then then do you seem to um
two weeks is uh is close enough
yes i think that would be good because i need to go to the management tender tell them what we are going to do and uh what's cost-wise okay and what's the time frame when what's a project plan
because uh without any other documentation so i cannot put it on management and says okay we'll want to do this and we need this much money okay so then
it's it's difficult for me to say will fit the season i need uh some kind of plan from you initially okay then we can how the for the discussion again
uh
are there other people who will be contributing to the plan
yes of course if you did some helper also let me know so the people you need the from the marketing or uh the technical side or the administration point of your key to add in your documentation or some technical point obviously just like my nose like an important all the intel can get plenty on this thank you
and uh the oh so what's what you'd think about uh
this uh project
for the remote control and did you have some already won something for your marketing strategy or uh the same strategy
right now yeah other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh what are building
their designs their ideas is uh
also to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into
yeah
there should be a fairly large market because uh
the number of people that uh
competition
yeah
uh i agree it has to be something has to be something
has to be something that that draws people say hey i like
yes
whether worse or not and they have their first say i like that like the design
and there's gonna be some changes
yes
so what i uh for for maybe uh you need to imply uh more with acoustic okay because
you know what she's going to do
okay and you know how to serve it
i see
because
uh she's doing the design but you're the core because you're the marketing okay so that you need to sell any you're responsible for the all the money the finance okay two more
so what i for for okay so you need to interact with the christian more and have it in our team okay with studying the functional design our technical design okay and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan okay how you're going to do those
your cells but
okay real audio what cost
no but on this than idea of how much uh we want to mark this for edges of the cell for headset
that's up to us to decide here so that you ought to decide okay so the best thing is you well both of uh the christian and you will discuss with your sil locate and come up with the cost and how we are going to
compete in the market \'kay and uh
technically or in the sales wise look at the commercial wise
okay then we ought to design okay how long it will take the whole project okay
how much is going to cost us and how much we are going to but but for the company
okay
of course it's it's uh uh
but for for everybody in direction
okay
so i think it's uh maybe if he can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan okay
including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the t. locate then it will help me to discuss with the management for for the booking and put it in the the proper project plan
and if you need it
any coordination in between uh come back to the maybe uh some technical wearing the solar commercial vendors okay difference if you want to have some of our marketing plan or technical plan okay so let me uh
okay i coordinate
or maybe
uh
your mike or accommodate
um between uh
well no not exactly i mean my job from what i understand it was
so like at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use a look of the best ways to do that
yeah
so i think i'll have to interact with christina suggested her yeah
so that she's not designing something back
my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to r. and so it's sort of it's only that feeds them but
i don't think necessarily that
i mean
in a coordinating
position yeah so basically you need to interact with \'cause student more okay for the user acceptability
yeah yeah and the testing of need then which will also feed into the marketing yes depending on what users want depends on how you sileye it might tag lines you attached to a
how you do it
make it more attractive to user so i think
all three groups so we'll need to interact quite a bit
and um
i guess build a plan based on our that is something you need to take all the factors into account
what it requires to locate the keep it in the low yeah easy you are uh meeting in christian meeting because he should know what's happening yeah we can see see ends on many discussions of most and reasonable on the males look at all the discussions to me because i need to submit to the manager
uh-huh
so any questions for our time being
so the immediate next that fails to start determining the functional design is that
still come over the functional design and uh to discuss with and locate how it would work and the cost of quality work
user acceptance oh okay how it looks like and how it's going to work in the market
'kay
so then we can discuss about uh for other things so
and uh
with this time
for me
'cause okay
thanks for coming which mine um
at the conclusion of a meeting could do could you send us a copy of your slides
yes ma'am i rent movies yes
i copy uh let let us keep all the emails and all the copy so appreciate each other okay so you know everybody what's happening
sure
okay
and if anything you need any time so please i do you can call me or just send me email or uh
just come and unlock my door okay so on my machine
good okay
okay thank you
and swimming in the ocean i stand there
yes
select
oh
chances are
as instantaneous
for uh this one
state are going to say here
um i did not know so yeah
i don't disappear and he's
'cause
thing of interest this there you go i don't need to that's for sure
'kay uh
it is
we get in and information i find
okay we'll come back
i hope for you have uh fresh air in the first time
how is it now the meeting actually we
gathering here
to discuss about the functional design
mate
yeah and uh we'll see some information from uh on a few indexing uh i think uh
the shading falter and i would invite uh the sixteen ending age and uh agnes to discuss it work on the various subjects
so you can go to the next slide
uh the age end of the meeting ease of opening
then uh
i'm going to talk about uh the project management what i'm going to do and uh of course i'm doing the project management executive board
'kay can take the minutes of the meeting
and that all three presentations on this uh new project well names
and a segment of wanted a decision on the remote control functions
and uh finally we are closing uh and the meeting time will be all forty minutes
so how to be very quick
and i'll come up with the management going with the new proposal okay i'm going to discuss with you one of those
oh what's this
your insides
in the aim of your project
but the one \'s uh
the teletext becomes uh all models
okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology
so
we don't need to constantly about the teletext and all in all the new project design
the second one is \'bout uh
the remote control
should be used only for the t_v
that's what our management says
i'm not taught avoid it so well waiting for him
to a stop list or the marketing or the corporate image
okay with this new project called new project
so i really wide uh
agnes can you go to the colors yeah
and this is the third side
okay good
so
i live by the existing to discuss about uh the functional design
'kay jana
and
yeah
so
'em
um you too
yeah yeah
john mister john miller
i don't see
yes
so why \'em
why i figured uh
we should
um identify some user requirements and from my experience i wanna uh and from
the research i did
uh the
the device has to turn television on and off the first time you press on the big button you can't tear
can have like a war falling on this point two million that he needs to be able to be able to find it
'cause won because problems with
remote controls \'s
finding them
so uh i also since we have to establish a corporate image on the basis of this new product
though they look at things that are popular and um pixel go beyond those and as i said and first meeting
um yeah and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction specially the yeah the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance and is reliable and so forth
i did a little history on that and the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth so
i guess this guy had seen if i created the flash dramatic
check out like the idea \'cause it made me think of phone um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the t_v on and off that might be interesting
and um \'kay so it was highly directional flashlight
then i could turn the picture on and off and the sound on and off and change channels so i think um those are still requirements we have today uh
fifty years later
and uh what was really a pioneering innovation but it was uh sensitive to the sun so that day would get would start off by the you get
with
easily \'cause um problems
so i
i in addition to uh looking at the um
uh the functional press all these devices are examples of where uh um they can represent
examples that are available today
i think the one in the middle
as a person
something to keep in mind be easy to find
hands down
it would uh eat
he did for it things if the t_v didn't turn it off you could
use it for something else
and since i'm not really um
the industrial designer i didn't know what to do with the slide
but um
i just took some
different uh schematics and i put them into this and i guess this is what the site might look like if you were drawing a circuit board again that i i don't know why i am
rest is
so
uh
personal preferences
um
i think we could uh i'm really thinking outside the box here i think that we should consider perhaps
having in it and at the size up
a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference so something is very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it
i think
um you could either be you could go either one extreme be very colorful or you could make it clear and um kind of
blend in with things so you don't have to um uh have a problem with the the the decoration of the of the user's home
um i think good it needs to be waterproof because uh sometimes they fall into cups and you know might be a by the swimming pool or something like that
um
if you i remember what what my requirements was about it needs to to tell you when it's done its job or not because at the time i keep pushing on the remote control and i don't know if it's actually
understood my message so i think it should give you some sort of an oral cue
and no course i never wanna replace the battery
so that's those are my preferences and that's my presentation
yeah let me uh interrupt you uh if you can add other facility other creature like uh unbreakable
yes will be because uh
especially today you know you have a family and the k. it's okay and the kids draw tend to play with the remaining time with the color yes okay so if he can add the future okay before you or or fabric whatever you the overall plan design okay with unbreakable locating that will give
a lot of advantage
for our product
good angle
good idea how how how do you can uh added in this
he's okay
okay huh tainted justin and uh uh any questions or uh classifications or
any discussion on the functional design
do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials
'cause for example in the unbreakable thing doing something plastic would be
harder where it is
having something like
i know steel or titanium isn't really economically
yeah
yeah possible will be handy too yeah
no i haven't really um
i want feedback i think we need to re rank these yeah but we'll see what you're a choice no preferences are now i'm just wondering whether
do you had any
i like titanium it's a light
yeah
expensive
yeah a marketing company
it was great you know nobody told me how much what our financial objective is so i'm
yeah
if you already inflate something it made you do it uh
this is the last meeting we're supposed to discuss about the financial thing
uh let me go quickly maybe they can go back
and working project plan and the budget
yes
yes
so
so
yes
yeah it's christians so
this thing
that's mine
uh i think you have it i will send you locate the project maybe the the project eight one k.
or the end of the day the company uh wants to make at least uh fifty million euros
okay
and uh of course applies will be ready reasonable on uh the sales side okay that maybe you give a talk to work the how much of the price and the what's there
how much it's cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be saved in the market
then uh you can come back with your feedback and uh i have one maybe the additional being in this remote control okay
it can be for like even more should be used for any t_v
'kay
and it would be silly
'kay and uh
that
not fat
might be hard to find
but let's try it working out the different uh the designs okay the functional designs
so any other questions
uh from our side i don't think uh
there's too many questions
okay
thank interested for our time being sold and uh
right
thank you to the marketing uh for the marketing side just to to give an idea what the manager is looking for
but
looking for uh
a remote control to um excuse me anything
oh
right
i have a sales price of twenty five year old
with a production price so tall and half a euro
from what uh i think from or trying to find which one we're looking for i don't think the press is exactly
in the mark
right
okay i'll explain myself you know in the sense that uh
in a recent survey \'s
uh from the ages from from fifteen to thirty five eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as training
twenty five euros uh that's
but it's pretty reasonable cause it's more proprietary
yeah for gonna take a risk yeah
yeah push this up a bit
make it more expensive but give them added things that they don't have now yeah
then they would they could possibly sell obviously risk is there too expensive than a combine
what
i think uh uh there's one other thing interesting to think of interesting i mean
is that uh from fifteen to thirty five year old room
which are we spend more money on train the new things
speech recognition \'s request
we're talking between each seventy five to ninety percent
of this group is one to pay you for speech recognition i'm not
obvious we can make a remote into a computer but maybe simple commands
lower
's after
on off
that might be a possibility even though it costs more
be the first on the market to produce that
thirty five percent say that too difficult to use
so it freer we make and more user friendly
uh fifty percent said they can't find the remote half the time
so maybe one word speech recognition commands save remote and there's a beep beep beep and they can find it through you know ten ten the newspapers magazines whatever you have at all
but
the cost that the the management is looking for is not gonna be possible
but if it's trained if it's fancy it's got some color too
it's very easy easy to use it does get simple remote speech remote uh control
what piece of our software change channel
on off
remote goes be people like a fireman we'll without spending half a day looking for getting all of cycling can turn the t_v on
so we have to look at it and
in this global idea
with
the idea is
and it sure
oh design
hi so obviously we have to talk
so what did think about uh
the design set this to the thing you can make it or or
uh i'm sorry
where did you go about uh the design uh what was talking about speech recognition speech recognition
well uh training is always an issue
'kay then
command simply so um might to uh
we can um
perhaps \'s um
do it
if the user is willing to
spend some time in the training process uh could reduce the
uh
the overall um
cost
not sure how
but um anyway um
uh \'em
uh i think also that the this might impact the battery life
and um so maybe what we'll have to do is
'em add something where you can
recharge it
wirelessly
so that do you do you have any sense in power to it
so or maybe i said out and assign it to a you know gets a from the light
um there's a solar cell inside there so that uh you have enough
yeah
and used to do all these fancy things
it seems also like with the speech recognition yeah it's a great feature but if you're watching t. v. there's a lot of ambient sound and it's words it's not just you know noise like something hitting
it's actual speech so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough
to filter out the t_v speech
and the the user speech otherwise you can say remote but if someone on the screen is saying the same thing
all of the sudden you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies
because they've trigger their remote control and it's turned out for t_v
so
i think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems
then yeah be a really good marketing gimmick but
i think we seriously need to consider how that went in
it's
the situation very good point
oh yeah
with speech recognition uh
oh no
yeah
um good or bad idea but um
if it's so one more
recognition because i know telephones in cars and things i've seen stacey uh friend mouses column all i think also mark
yeah
'kay the radio can be on and everything
'cause i think's with speech recognition of uh uh remote collect telephone
has it
exactly or
that has to hear
i don't think it would come through a sentence
television
somebody speaking with us in the television i stop and say
remote
mm yeah
so i think that uh something could be designed to recognize single woman oh yeah
yeah
well i think it's a great idea
if we can design it and say this is you everybody stays with probabilities call
so called immediately and then
so it's kind of cute
well what i can uh suggested kristin okay uh if you need some remote
the technical feedback
what's implied
okay
okay uh this facility especially for the speech recognition
i can become a new some companies like uh interior or i. p. um quickly because they're already in this speech recognition part okay
and they can maybe have some uh technical backup from them some kind of for technical tire
'kay uh if you want i can coordinate look at to get some information
okay and then uh let me know okay so what kind of uh
the details you require
okay to add this future
in this project
i don't think it's uh the difficult
and uh we need to know how much of the time frame you need to do that
apart from what
really
okay we'll find that out
from from your side there you have to go back to management \'s
yes the most precise what do they want uh
or risk
take a risk on the market something is gonna cost one but could very easily is it may come home in the market
'cause asset be something totally different hasn't always told me something that nobody has right
you can cast three end of the day you're the sales guy so i will come back and sit on your hard because you're going to be real says protection okay
it's uh of course it's um with joe well tell the management how much it's cost as a normal job and she went first okay
and uh so i don't mind to convince okay the management to spend some more money on the project okay if you can make a all pole
well there's
money from this well why responses to i don't mind to come as though the management okay the management says okay so that they don't want certain facilities which it's already work okay they want something the new okay i think uh like a speech recognition definitely there lately i don't think the signal for the shapes and uh i hope i can convince the management
okay
so if you have any a new idea also queue for uh you you can always combine the you can tell me if you need any
uh special okay uh coordination of cubic linear technical company which you can
high tech technology backup
'kay if
for fun
hello
technical design okay then i'm very good at
and uh what's your comments about uh
uh huh
well i mean if i go through my presentation you can sort of see what the user perspective is and how it ties into the other two comments yeah
so you'll finish it uh so i can uh
okay i yeah i know to me um
something
schools
right
yeah
right
let's see to the homeland and stuff
'kay
so
basically
the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like when people don't like about existing products in our case existing remote controls
and then what the good ideas are and what the bad ideas are and why they're bad and good which isn't always obvious we seem to have intuitions about why
things are good or things are bad but when you look
technically it how it works sometimes that's not the case
then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep his that'll feed into both
ends work kristen's work
um and then what the remote control should look like obviously once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are
so in terms of the functionalities that we need you obviously need to be able to turn the t_v on and off you need to change channels both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing you need to build to control the volume and then control any menus on the t_v
to regulate contrast or whatever
so the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls in general
the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do
'em off and you need to know specific button sequences
to get certain functionalities time um which you don't necessarily always remember especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often
and that the buttons are too small
so here we've got two examples where
here on the left hand side you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons the buttons in a lot of cases are tiny
um they're hard dusty and okay they're labeled but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much whereas on the other side you have a much simpler remote control
i think basically has a minimum functionalities
that are needed and it sort of looks simpler and just
less imposing when you first look at it so i would be inclined to go sort of towards this
in terms of designer rather than this
and if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons that we can figure out how to do it with existing
um buttons
so my personal preferences i had to keep the number of buttons to limit our to minimum sorry
make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed so like the on button being really obvious one
the channel changing and the volume
and to keep the design basically sleek and simple
which i think ties into what christine and adam both said
fairly reasonably
um so that's pretty much it and
i don't know if you guys have any
questions or
alright so uh um it seems to be very understandable clearly a research and uh
and now as the heading in the same direction
yeah and um
yeah
the one thing that i saw missing for um uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it yes that's true so uh you know but that's okay that's why we're all your table so that if we think of it in our research indicates certain things and um
well but it's complementary
i also think then it's um
uh
the uh the feel of it
's uh
can you hold it
is something that um
was expressed more in in in in my uh
design oh and that's logical and normal \'cause those are the parameters the industrial designer is more thinking about political look-and-feel
and uh that's definitely a very important factor especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost done
daily basis in a lot of cases i think
oh okay so have any questions sounds good
so
for anybody need uh any help from for time being
on this the subjects okay so
this come back to me and uh distant maybe i can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical
other companies to help you for a make a design uh slim
okay and to add some features like what we're talking for the speech recognition at all
should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include \'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table but
do we actually want to incorporate all of them or
we missed anything
you wanna go back and look at the closing slide maybe that would provide some guidance
so
'cause nine tell us uh
really this logic was just as individual actions
it says user interface so i suppose to do the components concept
supposed to work on the user interface concept and you're supposed to keep watching the trends
uh um in specific instructions will be sent by ah
oh sure
i thought we shouldn't do with many features just to start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process that's my suggestion
okay that would be great
and uh i'll send you uh images object if you want
i'm just thinking in terms of time is injected
yes no neglecting no you
i'm just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that were just gonna end up throwing away i mean it takes a lot of
time and effort
for everyone to
consider different features
'em
and if we spend the time and effort on features that we're not gonna use maybe it's better to spend it
on the
thinking more about features that we actually do want but
so why don't you just reasons nine for after the meeting because we are meeting time is running somebody else you gotta use this round and you know we can't hang out here yeah matter this so
okay what do this little will take for lunch break okay then uh we can discuss for them or
we do with our ideas and then we can find
no
so thanks for coming and uh i sent email soft meeting and uh please which are all information in the shelling folder so everybody can share the information
okay
so let's go for lunch time
i agree very much
oh
'kay
yeah
yeah
oh welcome back
hope to lie
i hope were really good lunch
yeah
oh
uh this meeting may i can tell she uh to discuss about uh
conceptual
design meeting
yeah
and uh agenda will be
don't want me to find uh that uh
the product manager or secretary that's me and the the presentations from the \'cause steve
and uh
'kay notice
and then you see a
finally in this meeting we have to decide
and you know to take a decision on the remote control
concepts
and uh
the functional design
so we forty minutes
i think it's uh
it could be uh you know but i i hope we can finish it up
so i'll handle to uh
the functionality into the christine we're here to discuss about uh the components
concept
okay
so uh if you could open the powerpoint presentation
i'm number two
to
components design
so uh i could put it in slide show oh yeah
right here
is that little that one yes please thank you
yes
so why \'em
and we were looking specifically at the components uh the following components
uh the case the power supply
uh means of communications with the television set
and then since we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition you have to have a microphone well in a dementia haven't
have to have microphone in the device
but \'em
maybe you didn't have it
the way it has to has to hear the speaker
and um so it could be the television set could be in the device but somewhere you have
put the microphone
um and no a way of making beeps or sound so you can find it when it gets lost
'em so the other thing that we
so
a method for
going about this is we've looked at uh at the store the historical record what's worked for hasn't
and then we also were um
the one to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because
course we
might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technology's capabilities to offer us so uh this is the approach that we took during our um her research
so i \'em for the case
um we told we were making this best case specific assumption that it would be curved in design course no i wanted it to be expand the ball and shrink a_b_l but
uh and that doesn't seem to be one of the choice not an option we can
we can really seriously explore
so then we were thinking about um rubber but um
and fortunately has been limited because of the heat uh factor and then um there might be some
problems with them and uh how it's
that goes with the board
uh and uh then plastic also has this problem melting and is brutally \'cause brittle after a while so um still had titanium in in word available
but um and fortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh than people in manufacturing say that could make curved cases that have titanium although
hello
apple did it with with
powerbook i'm not quite sure but
uh nevertheless so um they've eliminated all of our options except wide
so
i had this
and it is she said it's an environmentally friendly uh material so
were were
ling proposed thing
i will get all my personal preferences in just a second
so this this other matter of the chips and them well we could use a simple design on the board but
uh simple chips but that's only works for the bayes you don't get very much um intelligence with the simple one
and um then that was their regular which
i regret that i've forgotten exactly
why i'm eliminating that one
uh the other option was this advanced chip-on-print
and uh we like that we we found
uh it it includes is infrared sender which would member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip
and uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip-on-print so
uh would we uh
now gypping right to our personal preferences
well um yeah i really think we should you know use some of us some really exotic words
like um you know
uh well you guys come from tropical countries so you can can think of some trees and some nice words
i think that
people might really want to design their own cases you see they could do sort of a this um three dimensional design on the internet and then they could submit their borders can like you similar custom car order you know and you can choose the color the size of the wheels and the colors of the leather and things like that and then i uh i think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip
so this is the findings so far research and my recommendations
uh for the new remote control um would be to have \'em
have been made out of wood
many problems with that
can go back uh one slide
i'm not sure how well i know this let's go back up here and do this uh
oh \'cause chained uh
what's mean exactly i want to see
well
brain functioning okay
i think it's um that um i'm multiple uh chip design
um in it so maybe printed onto the circuit board
uh i could find out more about that is the the for the next fit next meeting is it'll look like was like well serviced or uh
i don't know but i'll find out more next week it will that would be great so the final note that modified remove this so that would be cool sounds good
remove the plastic room into those are possible to because um
's gets brittle
crack \'s
um
and \'em
we want we expect these um
and these remote controls to be around for several hundred years
so
yeah
it it
expression expression
well after us
cool
i don't speak for yourself i would
oh
i think with the window you run into the same types of problems with me i mean it chat said if you drop but
it's i'm not sure
yeah
three hundred combines actually read it is
yeah but i think in the cell if you use really good quality work that might work but you can't just you know
you'll see when you get to julia making use of the words are hard text yeah that way but there's some very creative output
um that's actually very innovative idea
okay good good
so we are having a hard time keeping my control of my uh it's
it's actually very innovative different idea that uh you you can choose your color or what
to talk to
um
this thing means each person had any other personalized individualized
speech recognition remote control in what
's
not on the market
slightly to easily slide the the design the functional design uh what would you do
um
in terms of comments on this data is is my only as well
i don't know what supposed to be
she works in the cubicle next to me so she's actually was already a little bit prepared for this uh
not that we had was not i mean
yeah
yeah
helping get the quality materials and then
it shouldn't influence the design principles to match which you'll see with my presentation and one thing we have to check those with the users whether
how quickly the novelty wears off and not having you would wanna have to have splinters in your yeah value for example
so
have to see how
kid friendly and it's and
and all that but
so like if your dog gets a hold of it they can use it
i
for t. thing
i do that a with rubber plastic so
yeah they do it with
uh materials as well yeah
c_r_l more
okay then uh let's move to uh i mean
sure
you know possibly true
's one
okay so
so it's a very short presentation \'cause i'm actually gonna try the layout on the board so
if you wanna just go straight to the second slide
uh which basically shows sort of i took the ideas that we're talking about last time
um and try to put that
into the remote controls the things that you can actually see on uh are the on off switch
volume and channel control the menu access button
ergonomic shape which i completely agree with christine \'s idea to have it sort of moulded so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the standard very straight remote controls
actually the other thing with the word if we take your customizing idea
is that people can actually do sort of quality measurements on their hand size of someone has larger hand my in s. y. different size on your for example
so that's actually really good idea of estimate customize ability
um one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen i just like you have on flip phones
so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally pressed her hand on especially if you have little kids around they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch t_v sharon accidentally change the channel or during um
else so
i had issues with batteries running at so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life light
on it that kinda goes domain dimmer and dimmer as your batteries starts to die
uh and in terms of invisible features audio and um tactile feedback on button passes um um and like you said speech recognition
so in terms of um what
they might actually look like
despite working in interface design not various errors and also you know are different
yeah something like that as well
on off switch fairly dave
sort of in a corner and by itself
so you don't accidentally turn your t_v off either transmit over the buttons
and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays
or
channels
and volume
sort of for surfing channels and then volumes of volume would be up and down
volume goes up and down and then channel structure right
and then here you have your sort of standard
telephone ish
number
and then on one side you would have access to the menu
on your t_v
and on the other side
a way to turn off the voice control
so that if the user doesn't want to use their voice they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control on accidentally
changing things on it
um so you could have a lousy light somewhere
i like
and
right
i don't know
so as you can see it's a very very simple design which is one of the things i really wanted to keep
keep it simple and not have too many buttons not have too many functionality stored into it
i think the design can pretty much carry over to everything although with the with the flip screen
like you have to do something slightly
hinge
we like a copper and sure yeah we just have to start watching if in a way it's depending on how much the the flip-screen why it away
um i don't know control only to start getting to her
but that's the general layout with the general functionalities
or something else
as you can see there's a lot of space out there for a remote control
and if you to customize it maybe
we can make this thing fairly small uh right
no no
personal preferences
so
that's pretty much
all i had to say i mean everything else in terms of design issues
i'm the centering of the keypad and
the channel is just depending on where your thumb is
and you tend to use the the volume control and uh
the browsing more than the actual number pad so that would be sort of interactive liner for your thumb goes when you're holding the remote control
the number pad little bit lower \'cause it's used less frequently um um
so once we decide exactly what we want to then we can figure out the exact positioning
but more latitude you go along those lines
so what's your uh
comments or uh
simple design
so customers want
okay
sounds like his team we have a product here
yeah
probably is obviously going to cost
um
'kay i also
very simple
presentation is comes from a marketing point you have to see what the consumers want
also uh
copied uh
different type of remote
if you
fine
all right bad
i shall be one in here
right
trying
much
sure
so be modified
we still go for it
my name is simple
questionnaires in different areas because there was obviously we have to see whether commas consumers are looking for today fixes uh trends change very very quickly
and six months maybe this idea has already gone out the window so it's gonna question how fast we can act
uh they already are expressed in my uh
no
go to finals no
so we go to
uh market train
this is what we know from the last uh from one
questionnaire similar although service with the fancy feel good that's what we were looking for something that feels good in the hand that's easy to use
looking for next generation of innovation because all the remotes out there now are all very similar they all do the same thing
yet or something completely
'kay
easy to use as always become has become another major interest that uh
with the whiteboard we can see it's a remote that's easy to use
and i think this is another thing is interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting selling technology
so even if we are product that may be more expensive
if it comes out right
if they didn't look it looks and feels good and has technology
the second two you can see the last one is a very easy simple design
the second one there's about uh uh forty five thousand different buttons on it which makes it fairly hard to read per ideas the first one i see
but they put a little display
or something else and with a little flip-open wearing what kinds of things simple way to flip up a table display on the flip-open one close it everything's locked
yeah
maybe the display also makes it easier to use because sometimes in new looking for buttons maybe if you see a display
context sensitive instructions
oh okay earning a much better but no the t_v or the davey d. or something else i've seen specially mostly the standard really sounding speech alienation yeah you have one with a very simple also the idea is simple but with the display
so you could see what you're doing
so maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use
trendy fancy
feels good
uh
with the display
would designer would design a colors
yeah maybe magic or d. s. n.
somebody orders the device
the kids send them like um
he uh
uh
some sort of a phone rubber
uh \'em
older yeah and then they would squeeze it they would take the shape of their hand yeah so it's really molded to his ears were sitting there and then you would know like
um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh score the screen
really
i don't really
right
but that for that you gotta do sort of an average across families and that's right and so you would not less than everyone has their own personal remote on that that actually would increase the um the resonator
yeah
true true
no but incorporating the three uh
obviously do something totally new on the market
yeah
totally different
for already the customize ability is
a really good sort of
when you get with the uh with uh nokia the chemo
changeable covers
um yeah taking marking for another phase taken off chronic depression
and and that's my soul millions
millions
so
so with the with the findings when the research is easy to use something totally new
we had come up with something totally new that's not
we also have to work um consider that to who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes to my
one and learn about um labor wise
you know in different countries and stuff with so we can do it cheap but i don't want to exploit uh labor in um
third world countries
to actually return it you turn around and say that your um part of the reason the cost is high for the devices because
um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made
the device
but we can get a production in uh
countries like uh custom anyways yeah yes and just like in your chain or a male she also
you can build better futures and butterflies and you can some more
so
that would that be something that manufacturing would have to
yeah \'em
yeah explore more and and to where where manufacturers is
one of the stuff
yeah we're here to design
yes uh but uh that's the problem i can talk about the production later sequence on the the quantity of the um um so we don't need to have uh only one uh fabric factory or something so we can have a carpeted room
to do the fabric okay with the different uh electronics items then we can have it
business trial and go-there quite the cost
to some more
so
but to let let's decide first about uh components concept and uh interface concept
we could use
except for for both of you what uh it was talking
and your design
with uh you wanted the display or the door display or just a simple so
i think it depends i mean i think it's a good idea but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the t_v you already have
a big display right in front of you
um
so
if we're trying to keep costs down
then maybe sacrificing the display
um
is a way to go i mean depends on how much putting a display cost and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for and um \'cause if it's only used for one little thing than putting in a big display case for a big display that's
probably expensive just to do the training on the chip
for the speech recognition or whatever
may not be the most cost efficient way to go but
that's just sort of speculation i mean
would you think engine
you like the display and one of the concepts that you show
um do you know how much it costs uh
uh \'em
to to add a little display like this uh
so
when they can actually um so find out
it's
'cause we have to find out cost or
okay
sorry about that because the problem under from pushing it after is made
our market
once we get a price on it then we
marketing
so
the advanced chip-on-print \'s but um
well we've
but we decide
we've determined in the uh
engineering industrial design \'s the recommendation
and um i think we've kinda come to some
agreement regarding \'em
this concept of a wooden case
yeah
a customizable and
nice
config hardly what about you what button is with
where the buttons be waiting \'til uh
uh i don't think so so now i think they could be rubber glacier now so you have that old hat little experience of
yeah so
well what we'll do is uh we'll we'll stick with uh the simple design for time being until uh i find notes about uh how much it's cost of extra in case people for the display
okay so maybe what you can do is um both of you can come up with uh
the program \'kay
with people more than okay
okay
sure
so well \'em
are we done this mean
uh i hope uh for is it okay uh they will have come up with the prototype design
okay then they can show you how it looks like and then we can uh submit to the
i would submit to the management
okay
and in that time you can come with a price how much it's cost is extra for the the display
and i'm marketing strategy administrative extracurricular
on the fire
a lecture
of course you make money total so
not only by your mate when it will your commission
'kay so any questions
so by next meeting so please come up with uh the prototype
okay and uh then we can proceed from here
good good
oh
so thanks for all your efforts
and coming for the meeting again
and in the season
okay okay thank you
's um
uh huh
yeah
on the regular delay
yes
well my everybody
sure
i see
so this meeting agenda we can do today
design meeting
and uh
opening the p. of the second of the meeting minutes uh prototype presentation from uh the t_e
yeah
i need
oh it's
yes same the evaluation criteria yeah
the finance uh it's uh from my side from the management and uh production evaluation
then uh closing so we have forty minutes
to this \'cause
and uh finalize and
close
dot product project
i didn't for that
so
okay let's talk about uh maybe first uh
for the prototype
yeah okay
so and and so
i don't know presentation but it pretty much covers work that we have done so
if i'm missing anything potential documents me to do
yeah \'cause them
okay two two
yeah my
it's not the biggest powerpoint presentation or
so you two or three or three
i don't think it's the last one call
uh huh
no
then it's it's like look at that
final design
yeah it is named appropriately it is conceded
um \'kay okay
'cause
's
alright \'s so
from them when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting we decided that we wanted ergonomic shaped material that we chose was wait
and that the color would be customizable \'cause you can staying away
whatever color
'em
so in terms of function you have to be able to turn the t_v on and off volume and channel control menu control voice recognition control
and we've incorporated the l. c. d. screen on the flat panel as part of the design if we figure out it's too expensive problems to get
um so
turn pale
ah level products
this \'s
our remote control
with the flat-panel as you can see
said if you left that
the panel
you can save that lovely yellow l. c. d. display
'em
it's actually part of the of the yellow button you have a on-off button so it's really big hard to mess
you have the
the red um
triangles of the troubles or
changing the volume up
volume up down volume down
the green are the channel changing
then that's when i was very like very touchable displays
and then you have the numeric pad
in the dark blue at the bottom
and \'s all in
the right hand side you have
the access to the menu on the t_v and on the left hand side
he had uh
he
the the ability to turn off the voice recognition
so this is pretty much what we had on the whiteboard the last time
um and uh it's
yeah additional feature on the back
's you can have your own customized
backing and i suppose you could do the same thing on the flat case on the front
so that you can really make this a highly highly customizable remote control
we haven't uh \'em
uh specified where the speaker where the microphone will be placed
that depends um the design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left
'em yeah
i think the microphone is on the top
oh yes okay so
and the flip
so that would be the sieve
so
we need the chip
it's not on the chip because you need to have my
remote system and um it depends on the design of the circuit board
yes but he shouldn't be under the p_l_p either because you can have the remote control close but you still might want to
well that's activated by voice yeah but uh
my opinion of doing that but on the flip because whenever you want to
the talk will \'cause then you can speak then you can close it
but if you put it on uh on the flip okay then uh
technical i i don't think it's a feasible
because most of the time is beginning to recognize that if you've already got the remote control your hand need to open the flip to use the voice why use the voice why not just use your hand
i mean the whole point of the voice is that of the remote control is sitting there and i'm too lazy to reach over and pick it out
i can just use my voice as the as my hand and the popcorn bowl and um holding my couple coca cola and the other hand
yeah
you don't wanna like go by the robot
yeah
i mean it doesn't have to be on the flip it can be on the side of my exercise i smoothing his work so that's working so i mean i can pass around it
yes its own monster
yeah they replace them with a napkin
i see
this lapel microphone on the side i would have probably would have been a bit a missionary thing to be accessed um all the time to voice
yeah exactly
so it's been doing
so um
couple most of the artist
it's um
you just work on the weight a little bit
yes
yeah maybe the shape of the buttons the little um so it takes shape silence
and a stick incense fast looks more you know heavy but uh ten minutes compared to the other demon bits of less weight
i mean this is faster saying there's only so much you can do it we could have possibly made a lot thinner as well
that
part of the thing is it will
a lot of people say that they don't like something that's to lie because they don't feel like they have enough control over it
'cause i mean maybe this is excessively happy
i think he needs to have some way he needs to feel like you're still holding something
so that's pretty much it for a presentation actually or replied more than
yeah that's good
thank you are much
so any comments or uh
my prototype uses rule within this on it i'd use it
talked about \'em previous meetings
now goes to his next phase is the financial
just about to uh
so i'd come back to uh
so evaluation criteria i think uh that would be good
so
uh let's come to the finance i have some uh calculations which are made uh as further
the budget
so here you can look like uh the energy source and uh hand dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells
uh put optional somewhat option there and at once the chip-on-print that's what uh we were talking about that
so
then we have sample sensor and flashy speaker
then they'll be a complementary
then special color
i push-button
so at uh actual our budget was uh twelve point five euro but uh it's coming to nine point nine four euros so we are and uh below the budget
okay so stingy or saving some money
i think it's a good figure
yes for me
nice
congratulations you know we haven't got the mic yet so
really developing it does cut the cost one way to market it is it
maybe it's for some money we can utilize for order uh marketing
the say it's okay and uh
which is the pensive already
oh on this
problem
version or a cost analysis we do not have an l. c. display
l. c. display is gonna be very expensive as we do
but it's not filled inside you will have the present yeah yeah yeah okay sorry
so if we add up personally to the three year old
oh
well remote
now are up around about twelve twelve and a half
as to what
uh the company
had initially requested
so that means we can put the uh this billions at the end
'cause forced
production uh my input double question because we're talking about profit also
uh mine you'll see uh
the problem with uh our survey the the possibility of how many units can be sold what percentage of the market et cetera cetera because at all this has to be taken it
into consideration
uh this is just production cost it is not uh advertising cost is not transportation cost uh
is still there we had to one point they have will inflate yes
quite a bit
the cost of the cost of the unit
for the company
so to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million
oh
profit
really like it
this we are talking about one unit okay so then input into the quantity
okay
and the cost will come down
slide both customization because this is being them in on the on on order basis might be uh that the quantities mo drive the circuit board will be right would be produced in quantity but the cost of the case would uh
can be fixed in the
uh you get some pretty cheap labor they can do this case for one euro
x. files really that's the course material analytical
it's really
stan
um
but anyway still we are under control okay so what uh i would do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors quickly to get uh
the production cost less \'kay so that we can save some money
okay to put in with our marketing more uh we know the promotions whatever
okay
so that uh i would look often i mean speak to the management in the computational some more uh
'cause don't
if we can go to to my display
we'll come back to yours
'cause just to give
everybody an idea of the market
now scare everybody out of this project
yeah
if i'm still here person or persons yeah
yeah um well
yeah
for abuse me is going to be uh trendwatch
that's the same one you did before
shouldn't be
and i sat right now
yeah
that's not the same one you have to go back and find another one
whatever it may be
popped up
uh uh functional try functional might not be even normalcy
and looks like it there
yep that's it so \'cause screen by screen
oh no
since uh we need to have some trouble ideal market uh we had independent status as it does this market has availability um so what we need eight million units per year
okay
our internal company evaluation poster between eighty nine million which is proximity same as independence day
um so if we continue
and look at the findings
next screen
which means that uh if we have a target of two million with the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year
which is actually a tremendous amount
i'm not keeping
no kidding
uh maybe they already expect so if we put an inflated price of fifty euro or production cost they cannot exceed
twenty five euro okay we're already in yeah there
price
okay with transport
promotion labor \'cause you may be included the promotion the cost
um transport for the material to the stores or whatever our home over break this down between our
how're retailers
twenty five percent of the market to get to two million units or two main units we have to have a profit of twenty five euro per unit to get to the fifty million you know if your profit
yep
okay
so
obviously remember i just had agreed on the evaluation before
a fairly uh fancy stylish and most of the of the you know the ease of use
speech recognition
cost we've gone through these know companies most evaluate
the feasibility would be able to take enough to the market
to justify production
what we project is over two euros
but be that the market changes very very quickly maybe there's no more interesting by this thing in eighteen months from
so you know you have to move decision
'kay and the company still to me in your answer
can it still work
for fifty euros canonical findings
'em
i would uh like to explore the possibility of using an alternative
um delivery in sales channel which would be um to use the internet i was thinking the thing for promotion and ordering and then to drop ship the product to the customers residents that we have no storage yet no um you do have transportation instead of the labor cost which you don't have the transport to the
um point of sale yes yeah point of sale is online
yeah you do the shopping center somewhere
or strategically place shipping centers rather minimize
that's on syntax should sell through um assigned a bill very well yeah yeah
as an idea i'm going to work uh um
to find more fulfilled but still technology uh what you are selling your uh
unique products uh
it actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customizable \'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have
see maybe what other people have done one the range of possibilities that whereas if you're in a store
you can't
unless you're highly imaginative
person and you may not really know what it is you want whereas on the web if you have a bunch of pictures you can serve trigger ideas and
and you can even have a and a movie that you can rotate the object and look at that yeah no i think you're missing really is the the way you wanted to the feel of the product
but
we're getting used to then it's not quite like trying an issue but
people are getting used to buying things online they can't touch
the full surround sound through with watches to you can customize what you can see how it is that's the end of the production you can change it uh
is a lot a long way it is doing this now
you wrote to look on it and look this way
as possible do this maybe there's a possibility of something more than two minute someone you wish
she's believe feasibility uh
well with the price um
'kay
right
i'm doing this uh the only one that uh
okay then uh let's wait for the production okay then uh you can evaluate the product so it looks like technically in the room
uh have you
what turnaround time do we have
'cause any production evaluation and you were very very quick or very rarely so it's it's really great
of course it will uh come back into weeks
we wouldn't do it
for for me evolution okay
prototypes you mean
yes the um um parallel product evaluation
well should do some market tests uh once we have prototypes and distant borders and things like that in
test marketed
through another marker for people to do indeed do this you gave them in give you will make some form it's minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use
it's not trivial talks is because we are we are not going to do to know all quality okay so we can no no for what we definitely shouldn't do it you attribute
so go into the other place
and i don't think it's take modern problems time
okay so that's uh we'll production will be installed once we product evaluation
okay been there
it's not moving uh
the technical team and uh
your team
okay
from the management
the meeting
uh
okay
any outstanding
so any any other uh questions or uh comments to be
'cause \'cause
no huh
i think we've very much covered everything
okay so they do have something i just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation and what about time for a redesign
yeah \'ve
the user's come back and tell us no this is bad this is bad we want this done differently
okay uh
let's take like this let's proceed with this model okay for the for the
market introduction okay so no more changes would be made okay
in this
the basic design
'kay
we will introduce this modern-day and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers then
we can uh go for the
second generation generation
'kay tsk
there's not and there's no limit
the problem is that we know is like a generation of the first generation flanders for some silly reason and
get a customer right now general idea
they'll they'll more taste
okay so that is annoying
'cause no limit
no but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine tune just to
a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that
we think will work but we don't really have anything to language specific
yeah so that's the reason you are here for uh the design
okay i hope everybody has little and i'm not
everybody i mean the whole point \'em user evaluation is to see what real people need we have our own motivations in mind we have around ideas in mind but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell
yeah but uh see we oughta take a few considerations are going on the the price consideration one of the few to consideration okay like uh you can you tell you cannot do it more like a need more chilly okay
so it depends on the individual taste
you know so we have we had to balance somewhere
yeah of course i'm just trying to point out that i think that year evaluation and redesign turnaround time is to
sure well you have no redesign not you personally but
yeah and the product will have i dunno doesn't
redesign time means
yeah
do you know what season of the year time of the year is the most important for t_v remote control sales
would it be the christmas season by any chance the sports time sports sees
or for which sports all hope
cool
so soccer they need those the we've already have been involved occupied needed to be
we can remote control
so i think what we need to do is perhaps just synchronized the final though the launch of a user tested device with some special event yeah that's a good idea and then um so that gives us a little more time perhaps than we anticipated because
i don't know when the world cup is but i'm sure there's gonna be one major sport
oh another more major sports event probably not the um the football games coming at the end of january i think that might be a little too aggressive yeah uh but
so i'm just like yeah pointing out uh uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing the press and then to launch
um added a major sports event or uh perhaps to uh i was still in place to advertise that tivo and to work with motion pictures and there might be some motion picture that are coming out
um when they're coming out on d. v. d. that uh they need to have an special remote control to work with it so we could maybe work at a campaign with uh with sony pictures for example maybe some management has got
have relationships there we can my friend she is uh that of course uh i'm convinced amounting to do that
that's great
there's just something to keep in mind is this really really avoid a lot of products have gone out there without being popular user test that are completely flocked when in fact it gets re released a few years down the line that with proper testing and it takes off like crazy
disposable diapers is an example of that in fact anyway he had started it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years there was a disposable consumer product
and uh
people in the market
haven't really
gotten onto the concept that you could use something and then throw it away \'cause wasn't there
but then when they re launched in thirty years later they were virtually the same design the people had gotten the throw away you know paper caps and map get all kinds of things that
hadn't \'em so yeah you're right timing is very important but i think we've got a good product
yeah the cities and areas here that's right from what uh the brand right here
on the program
it's gonna be very important to the company
you're behind the scene and he's uh friends clean so yeah
he'll be he's three
i don't like it
good luck
a lot
marketer uh
he looked very relaxed he considering you know the uh
straight
others yeah
okay so then uh that's come to uh closing recently \'cause within the budget
and uh is the project evaluated okay so that will uh come so
okay for the but our time being said thanks for all your efforts and play pool okay in the great design
and uh let's leave it to the act later for once production is
for and the minute i met some folks
so let's meter uh this evening to hang up
closer working
sounds good good thank you nice working with your data
thank you
i think a good quality
right
i see only an important labels only use your own
oh
um
or what
um
uh huh
hm
