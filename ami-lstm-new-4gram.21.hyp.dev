page
head counts
oh sorry
how we placed in terms of
yeah sorry
yeah okay if it's comfortable yeah
yeah
yes slash prior to this string actually pull out a little different from each applicant yeah that's it okay
and back up and sounds while time
oh
i think that's phone calls
um
that's what
right
on the hard to drink coffee
and uh
um
okay
okay
are you critical
okay
but
yeah
writes justice to this powerpoint clockwork
yeah
powerpoint
very efficient yeah well
it's it's it's
hm yeah
yeah
because this kind of getting into it
right um
so
just pick up the meeting basically um so we're working now for real reaction this is oh so
right
scum agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting about um
good and just do a quick opening the middle floor get acquainted with one another um the word start talk a little bit about tool training essentially that means getting used to
the only thing that we haven't tried out yet the whiteboard
um we've got a general plan for the project how are gonna go about accomplishing this and then just the discussion close up
um
ah oh
because you know
okay my site um in real life um so yeah
basically it
i'm like to i'm just gonna you get of course you can discuss i'm thinking about um
proposing that
since we've got this weird blend of
our selves and our roles
that we just don't ask don't tell
um so um if you say something about marketing right sorted um is gonna be easy to go from there exactly the kind of um every other day if you guys at the same time if you like logically something that's of economic
we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of the paper book you know
you select well it doesn't seem like such a good idea because the backs obviously go with it
um and we'll discuss it but
i'm not gonna ask you know that
or is in the upper right
yeah yeah yeah exactly so
because world war sort of role playing see agree yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well
um that's the same for your when we do introductions i mean um
and you talk about your background you have find you make your way to um
uh
you know maybe it you're like an idiot like u. c. s. b. but you might say you want to hire or something like that one i know you can
this is i guess you could have a little the phone itself
hey guys okay with that is that seem logical
oh yeah it's
she actually so
cool
so
i guess they did
were totally or
we're making a remote control which is thrilling um
uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate mono and if you guys had time to check the inner life and if you guess it did checked the um
uh
the corporate website um we've got
to make something as fashionable as possible that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to
make it nice you know like john lewis nicer you know if you go to damage or something
so um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way
um
we're gonna go about doing that is basically the first we're gonna start on the basics and that's running need you guys user interface designers and the um
um
the
other designer that i can't remember the
the idea of the u. i. d. right now
yeah
the industrial designer hey
finally getting into it
um
to guide me and guidance on this project \'cause you're gonna be you get you guys at the bottom you know you i cannot you can't do that you can't have you know x. and y. um at the same time
and then um
or got from what is necessary to more like
what would be cool it
you know like um
i think yes but at the same the mouse i did but the idea of um
yes the coffee pipe needs to be able to hold coffee
but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that if you touch your head or something like that
um
it's a will work out from there and um then we learned talk at and then finally what
incorporate is kind of the last taken away you guys build the power tell me tell us what's possible and you tell
that's why we can
um
hope for in what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer in that off obviously a u. i. d. and the idea you know you can keep on the recording at the cutting edge of how to get about maximizing what is possible
um to kind of sink it all up
so that's a detailed design so it's a three state kind of thing
um
right so for now just for the with the whiteboard um
basically i just the used to it i haven't tried it yet either
um i'm just gonna start here and don't need to carry like five remotes around
um and
just write down i'm scared i don't want to the needs of my um
there's a disk you know if you if you were trapped on it as a violin you could only bring five c. d.s along with your name one of them that you could not all five if you wanna off i'd go for it but in one of them that you could
um oh
we skip interactions
nice
and the pixel project manager
um
i'm marty
i don't know what you uni uh the easy santa barbara that you're working on a p. h. d. in psychology
um
yeah
so
i'm sarah i went to michigan and now i'm here in cultural studies
and i'm the marketing manager something marketing expert expert templates of their plans but i think
um run uh once upon a time studied in victoria
and i and um the
user interface design
and then from
california indicating uh
my screen such a thought
but you could hear anything you set up a comment about together
okay
right so that's what i meant yes
to to do if you write it down or you tell us well you know you are just gonna a couple of it
yeah the music anything as i'm assuming anybody likes meetings or some lesser or greater extent but for some other options if your t_v
s_l_t like i am mikes model fairly well oh some of it is rubbish but i went to high school time willing actually
i got
the the make the guy laugh yeah
is your main or yeah
oh
very much step
hello soccer player but a total bastard modules really top like he's got sick so he's a big guy
the
uh okay so
i really like him badly
because of department
who
um
as there was like another meeting will have
um
and um no other matters of rubber interested in there um
you get to operate in some income
okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noise the thing
it's kinda weird interesting yeah yeah like present g_a_b_b_l
uh
let's see
alright so um what was again next week and write down some television watcher
whatever you want
i guess i'm kinda extension right
okay all these all night
one of the um yeah okay
basically hand right
okay
volume much taller than easily
um
oh
right now all i'm listening to the uh
similar growl
press that key mutilation in
posted a nice uh really lame
and uh
i know
i didn't really
probably class called totally okay yeah uh i mean
um
um
um and make it with a these well you had only right that women of family guy is it is it did you watch the new season no one
are you get it online or is it gonna start letting it yeah
and in that is
alright
most of the on the
hm
oh
yeah oh man trainer i've read as a variable
after big orchestra
yeah there are two reasons i dislike fruity numbers
for one
uh and open your the concert in belgium
the what exciting
i was having a ten
um
thing i love about whatever
and i think windows
it
action into powerpoint
because i designed specifically to ignore ideas to build just the five by five i can't read that much
uh yes yes it's okay or
well it
that's cool yeah uh itself horrible i've seen more you're in this industry before obviously
i just came from glasgow uh
happy to say that there's there's a salient contribute approximately
it's a whole meeting in
it really should be so
the uh
right
right yeah
huh
hm meeting in next
yeah
i'm going to land in there you don't work will have to be here for three years some anything at the terminology right
i've already got more than i can keep track of my i'm gonna go home next weekend and make it only guide you to close your home yet now they'll be like
see something british even like i'll shut up a normal uh it should be interesting
yeah i mean i tell not coming back
yeah uh
three q. so you're gonna stay here
probably release get a work visa for a while and then decide
the cat related yeah indices are a blessing to yeah yeah
uh yeah i think it's still the other one well yeah that's why it's hard work yeah
something in this stuff and tell
i miss coffee right in his body
uh uh cost less than oh yeah to to maintain sorta like we're working from a government i'd rather say you did a lot yeah uh um
why uh he ever said it would be achieved
yeah oh really uh i lost lives in search described
cal
well i want something out for myself to see going to certain ignore account sorry you
you just can't get event really was jealous and set it up
it's safer \'cause in san diego
this was his or her general
probably harvesting
it must make all the difference yeah i was just uh
it is
it this other things to this you just can't places like or whatever the school and you deserve our descent on top
the mexican food is okay
it's so good
like a yeah like two bucks like where the tool box
mismatch right i guess yeah
good call
yeah
where you from sending them
um
just literally just measure all say rather like five minutes user okay so nevada's
alright yeah i got cancelled on
then the second death
yeah
close uh your current half job is by university yeah imports yeah yeah it's actually like literally happen often
that's cool yeah variable small
yeah as we were discussing before
for all the same
well
general really
right so okay success on the whiteboard you can harness your answer now a little bit infections we talked about summer season
things you like about the same there are single
um right so that we want to not find stuff other project finance
um basically what we're trying to do this eligible for twenty five euros
um
this is what the finance department is told me the c. f. o. but i don't know
i'm not sold on this is pretty dire i mean
twenty
that's like you know forty bucks for a remote you have to
pretty much like you might wanna reform it to i'm so what we can maybe work on that later but we're gonna make a one and the proper names to make fifty million euros on your internationally so
um
one of things that i was gonna mention to get the designers is that
um it um we probably need a river it needs to be a universal remote control probably okay um so something that could do n. t. s. c. as well as pile as well as various other formats like it's gonna control the disease but um you know only lets you guys but that's something that is gonna be international sort of thing
um one try to make it for twelve fifty
so i will try to make a hundred percent half an hour if we can't
um ps right so i'm just the close up i'm not sure how much time ideas and extract right project manager
sort of
um
is i will need another half an hour or so um
and i like the um industrial then you get to think about what needs to be done like what the basic function of it
um
u. i. d.
well yeah you're right get your time is up there you also get assignments from in your email as well more sparse specific somewhat to do
um based around so he need you to tell us what um
we what the users want to look at so
actually the way you guys
could maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user is gonna want and what the user can have you know like um associate
yeah well it is a when will discuss the trade offs in between um and so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email
but i think that that is more or less a good place to start from now um and there's more things come up will have meetings and
the emails and so forth
um
any questions before we get started
i assume that we're building a standalone uh remote control
we can't kind of build into other
uh product
yeah
you mean the layer and since like a mobile phone
just
um
um it's it's interesting
yeah
i don't think there's any rules about it yet another personal coach will
yeah
word works you know say can we pretty can we sell of
remote control phone for twenty five pounds
well i have i think about it i mean again i'm i'm certainly open it seems like yeah it seems like it's certainly doable isn't it
i mean um
or if we can't have a for mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function
the clap and i mean it can be no good idea gonna go see it visually
every boat changeable faces like face they can buy for uh like uh i dunno like that part
huh
yeah
it's true i guess we would probably have some time maybe we should bring circa below what we're gonna do
go back to um
i really haven't let me bring up something about
our basic goals here what we want to
accomplish
uh project announcement
okay
uh
yeah
not so much
from
i will find him or her own
now we also discussing however initial ideas yeah yeah that's still it's still
so write up an initial ideas
i'm not going to take notes on this to us
okay
step two minute yeah oh never um
it's initial ideas
good
that's pretty much again it's gonna be universal
yeah we decide that already
and it need the function for other things as you said there's like all the other things you can't remote still like your microwave or a friend you are like
ten evident but then
never been a fan those huge remotes that have like a million buttons you can't do anything smaller data sample
i don't think he specific
i'm thinking
kind of p. d. eight uh
design so touch screen design
rather than one house so that you can tell if you're sitting around all sorts of different things
yeah that's like isn't it i mean my
step test yeah they deserve yeah
so we got five minutes more to check us perfect
um so that is kind of an idea of a trade-off between um
uh size and functionality
oh yeah we also the month multi-functional but at the same time it against you too much you're not really low tell them apart and it's complicated yeah check out of the buttons
thanks
i was gonna node
for future reference this idea uh um
so you like in the black and out like a touch screen type of remote the um
possible
i don't think well into this option includes needs one outstanding feature set apart from quality of the image yeah all the other universal remotes
um i don't know if there's such thing out there i guess we'll do some do some research on or whatever space or is a general about whether or not there are um ortiz format
like um
you know how immediacy region one
right
oh
pretty sure there is
i mean i i have a friend or has a p. d. a. okay that he displayed
pointed his toward any television he wants and figure out there
the specifications of it more control
interests also uh so i assume that that can be done with uh looking around the room
okay
um alright so
i like um like an an idea this idea a touch screen remote with multi format features um right
um
let's see
i think making at a nice material would be very important because so many of this remote stacy is universal remotes look so cheap and low quality and nice and slick
it would be important
and
i don't know like
this is a problem with using them
adding this whole like p. d. a. pen business is only one more thing the blues are gonna be careful what like
just something like keep in mind we start actually deal with this stuff
it would be really cool
i see
um
i like the idea of the of multiply
uh yeah it won't let me call the speech please please
namely the faceplates and it's uh ellen will have to combine
yeah which has happened really was you want as well
well that's cool user loses
yeah
um
what
i think it would be such a bad idea to have a car locator device
it is simple but then you have an intelligent help you find your answer
um metaphor bundling it
unless you sign their telly with the remote right
um
well if we bundles of phone then he can always call it
true if
you're not doing that then we can have something that just kinda rings from either
well there used to be those whistling devices but that's aluminum like
cool could not be something more like just a little look like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote but you could place somewhere else that you press and it makes a remote page
kinda like i wonder what um
uh cordless regular phones and the other page button does break we do something like that it's cool i think so
i think we could design yeah
get it
um
yeah i think this material qualities well like i guess what we can think about what kind of um
uh
you know the apples be really successful with the surgical why kind of distance obviously kinda no titanium the new silver sleek ones last couple years yeah pretty much self curves
the yeah would you have the minimum i'm i'm not i mean we're talking finances that are not selling out a forty pound remote what our forty dollar remote twenty five euro remote would be pretty
you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price
without without
getting that whole like you know good on the bargain store remote you know bargain serena remote that's black and you know massive some kind of analog balance there and some are definitely but um
have a think about what we can do you have to think about what we what to do or how we're gonna sell it yeah regular users are mind like these
grammars are not gonna be into this whole new let's design remotes they use the buttons so after careful of exactly what working a stereo in who we're gonna be able to get out of
that's true
we're talking twenty five pounds or twenty five euros twenty five euros
oh
it's like
it's
yeah
they're all weaker than the roster from the dollar
and without computer parts
oh if you can upgrade your computer by in the states like um together fries
each computer uh electronic store
they serve um
obviously has
they will sell things overseas
so you can buy stuff in america never shipped over five twenty pounds of uh
right so um
let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now
i'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got
in the um
project documents so if you guys might need a reminder about the white
we've talked about on the different you know kind of trade offs that we've got and other ideas you can get software you'll be sure
and uh right so thanks for that that's just a head back to work on what we're talking about for uh
got it yet getting into
yeah half an hour
um yes okay
i'm scared called
i think you're right
yeah
outside
a set aside okay
cool all right so um
basically i'm just gonna uh go over real quickly um some news i just got from the board how we're supposed to do with this um remote control and and or turnover you guys to make representations um on what you found
and then we'll have uh the discussion
so basically i well i just turn off the board and if he gets got the same as well but he needs to be television only
so no we're doing t_v we're not doing anything else it's just gonna be television remote
um it also needs to have the company colors included in it
um so it's red and black and has to have a slogan
\'cause gets to get the slogan it's we put fashion in electronics
um
in no teletext i'm not sure teletext is but um assuming you guys do so we don't wanna include that
um in this particular design
for reasons that i
i don't really know
this but it's the board so there you go
so basically um
given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later i mean \'cause it's television only we will be able to um change our uh
um
well we can sacrificed more function for a better television remote anyway so data over to the industrial designer i'd go ahead and make a presentation
so kay
so do i plug manually in
display here
yeah
may be a function i think the statistical model
got it okay
right
as page one
my presentation abilities
first powerpoint last night
so the uh method we're gonna have to understand how remote controls work mindset
successfully complete this project
um
remote control works as follows
it's all pretty basic stuff you lines
um
sends messages to another system
so
there's an energy source involved and not like a battery or solar power
something along those lines
is an integrated circuit just the microchip
uh not actually compose messages
and usually the way yeah remote control works as it sends infrared bits to another system
uh user interface controls the chip
basically that's the casing and the buttons
and um recording the messages as well
so my findings um still uh preliminary study here and uh i found that too much metal remote design could potentially cause interference
the ability of the remote to send commands
in too much no can cause remotes behaving unexpectedly very simple signals
uh the too much mills you sometimes people pick up radio signals and like
and there's also the possibility the remote catching on fire injuring the customer
just think of those lost it already later
therefore i suggest primarily plastic construction
um
components just some ideas that i had um
energy source
it's kind of had to be eco-friendly so i thought maybe we could do something with solar power
with an outline battery backup
um user interface says this you can use metal i was thinking maybe a higher grade recycle plastic and
the chip
um so it can be a ship better wasting away around that we can't really be different in that respect
um the sender well i'm thinking infrared \'cause it is the industry standard multi channel
so we're going to happen to
and
yeah uh power on n. t. s. u. compatible and that
probably it's wonderful range
uh and the receiver of course the number of electronic devices
uh but in this case i mean two beeps
um personal preferences
i really think that wishes plastic is personal
company simply count
for it
this kinds of assets which have
and it really is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value you were thinking
is it is there a way that we can use um
modern
types of commas or moderate types of pass except maybe do you have some kind of aesthetic value
um
like in the white like the talk about like
or on the left of these laptop similar user are pretty nice
you can do is is another nice color better quality place that we can work with
yeah there should be a problem
um
for example that place gabrielle something is something that's
perfectly possible for us to do
i will save my presentation thank you very much
um if next week and have the um user interface developer go ahead and
take a brief presentation on that integrates well
um
spongy soft and yeah well
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh
well
yeah
um
function f. eight okay
hold down
hm
right okay
supplied them all
yeah i guess
you just see figure three
oh
oh
well so
here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation
uh huh so
if you the requirements we need here uh win
s. clean it up an electronic device it needs to be universal
um and possibly uh operator several different types of races although we know offline yes i detected see is that's no problem
um
so
so my findings um basically want to send messages uh to a television set
um that would be any number of different things uh
such a switch on the television uh switch the next channel that sort of thing i think we're all quite uh
quite intelligent no no what a normal remote control does
um
no
some of the other things i've found is a complicated remote control so that we can't quite see why read there very well that uh
this
my remote control has many functions
um so can do a lot of things but it uh is quite complicated most users will find it uh
find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time
to learn how to do that
as you also nice is quite a boring design
uh
another remote control
slightly different it's a simple remote control
uh
many less buttons but uh
house
many fewer functions um much easier for the user to manipulate and use
um
also that's a bit of a cheap plug and it's also quite point
so my personal preferences
uh-huh
revolutionized the idea of uh a remote control
um so retain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple format to display
uh fairly similar to work with
no it's gonna add another uh slide here but i think that
um okay just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple faceplates
what
great experiment
right
i mean i don't get that you think so
okay i can play until that would be perfect think yeah
side
or not give it a little bit
telling it
okay
so this is me um
basically i was looking through some marketing reports we've got um we had a usability test where
we were actually sort of like watching a hundred people
use t_v remote and see what it is that they're using and then they fill the question about what they like and what they do what about their general
t_v remote control practices
um
pretty much through testing we're finding out that most of the time
everybody's just using changing the channel turning on using the volume
um
the majority the time that all is going on the other functions happen for some people they're important but the primary users are really really basic
um and so big complicated remotes like one was on the last
presentation are really
not the general public's use they're not using a lot of it they don't need it
they find it frustrating when there are all those buttons they don't know what to do with
and um we also found out that a fifty percent more people there the worst thing about remote is how often they lose it and i can't find in a room
so i think what we're talking about with uh page or something will really come into play
with a lot of these people
um there's also uh survey about what they liked about remotes and pretty much they all think they're hideous
and not very useful and the younger demographics are really interested in voice recognition options
i don't know if that's already look into technically that that's design people but it is something we're thinking about especially since the other demographics obviously when it's gonna keep going
sell if that's the direction we're hand and it's something to think about
um but basically it really is the primary functions and get it to look nice which are
the standards
cell
it's a good start for us
that's great thank you sir
right and so um yeah i just uh
switch that you think you
finish a participant discussion help
plan on to the next phase
right so i think we've covered most of these important questions through this um
do you guys do presentations um
please direct uh the the industrial designer suggests there were pretty much uh emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic
um
so uh
she's recommended that we go for simple or functions so fewer functions um that we need to decide who we sell in this to use the years that suggested that
seventy five percent of people under thirty five one minute thought about voice control
um so do we wanna go for that
or do we want to go for older demographic and my thought is
um
we've guide
well if we're gonna go for sleek look i mean we are putting the fashion in electronics and
um
when uh via internet
pensioners of the world the s. cell so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic um
so
uh we need to wonder how about how we can make it
better and smaller and faster um
it would constrain the plastic very well we've got this idea uh aurora saying we need to think about uh revolutionize in the way it's looking um which might be easier give that we're going for simple function and the ones on for tally
um so um
it's
how would this voice operation thing is i think a good idea um
assuming that it's doable
um at least for the basic controls maybe we can balance it that way you know we can see
okay you can't say record alias tonight it said oh no we might be able to say um
volume up
yeah
right
i think it be possible to uh uh
combine the
locator device and the voice recognition technology
yeah oh
that could work
and like yeah
with the simple command like
okay
yeah yeah something very basic
construct a beep
right
when he found his elegantly within a two hundred foot range then
oh yeah i think it's fancy
the difficult see what would be in um i think
okay
you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find
can you have something that picks up
um a voice from far away skid pointed sitting on the couch
but then again you have as we this we thing you know just a little chip or whatever that has a page but maybe that could be voice activated to
a little sticky pad to stick on top of your television news say something to do that yeah yeah yeah
financier
or an isolated magnet or something like that you know some of that would interfere i don't know the technical thing but yeah i like that i like that the voice recognition for the paging system
um
the thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity
of the remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into voice control so it could be sold to both the younger market older market the younger market could use kind of the board voice control method
you know the regular unit just an option exactly you might consider the older market could use this simple design with the traditional buttons and whatnot
i was thinking something about the screen sony
okay
the uh
if we do this touchpad screen thing and we still do we know if that's an option technically
it's definitely an option to any of look into our hearts of uh touch-screen athletes and whatnot this year to be uh
you know almost as cheap as the button method at this point
\'cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be easier no four five basic functions you have um menu options i would have all these other complicated
voice recognition settings things that you not use every day and that a lot of people are can use but it is an option there for this high tech
market that sort of b. is this sleek thing we're going for
gotta wonder therefore adding so much technologies this one remote are still gonna be able to meet her twelve hundred twelve fifty euro
worth looking goal for selling these things and h_m_m it seems like
not kabila handle all those functions with just one microchip
my question is point the most expensive part of
turn it
the whole mechanism
yeah
so just something to consider
absolutely
okay um well
yeah i guess we'll cross that bridge um
until it aside later stages of development um but yeah that's
a perfectly viable question
okay um so
i'm saying that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic in a minute there um but then in the sense that it's bells and whistles
are available for anybody who wants um the basic rule maker sleek simple
um
function um
uh
remote control
um i think the voice recognition thing is up and we've got a market for it um i don't
many will be more likely cornering the market going as well we don't have many
um
yeah
it was the microphone it
cool
right now we don't have many people uh these not very many competitors out there they do that so called
um
right
because you can't we touched on most of this the idea of the paging function a touch-screen faceplates
um
the thing with icsi would not be uh uh we have maybe sacrifice the faceplates for touch screen
um i'm not sure that's necessarily correct i think you you kind of take the example of the mobile phone that
kind of has a portion of the device is not interchangeable where is the surrounding versions are interchangeable to the casing you have the casing be visible
okay
back to yeah the cost of material
we have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of faceplates
with the package
as something out for say we're including
three four faceplates contract the cost of blue and yellow questions if we don't put them out really in a position to evaluate
that market we have the new tests on
faceplates whether already
so you gotta if there's even interest out there
okay
right top of my head sounds kind of like
a gimmick i went
really go anywhere
yeah \'cause i haven't you will have to the wall itself like a cell phones like we have uh you know no cure model acts and then ten people make face plates for a week
yeah it just ah model for a of remote control
one listing of a spider phone is padded added around it is about emblematic arrest
you just sit home so somebody comes over to watch t_v
yeah
well hopefully some people have people coming over all true yeah most people have the intelligence of a living here
uh i what we can we can discuss that when it further when we think about um whether
the only
do costs and so forth um
true plastic is good cheap enough for making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um
yeah
yeah concept which later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important
um i think we've had a better discussion already only since the any other questions comments it came up in his presentations
what if we confirm that we're gonna go ahead with a a touch screen
yeah yeah okay
um
yeah i think that would be best let's
based on which one would you guys have also to me let's go for it
a plastic
build separable plastic cased \'cause that that there is easy on the cast try to look for some kind of high quality or second pass against you recommended this great idea with a touch screen for the basic
functions
um
um oh yeah but the provisional let's go for a touch screen with several sub menus um for possible extra stuff that want basically put that channel on the on and off switch on the touch screen
um
do we have
um maybe that occurs to me that if we have a touch-screen people are gonna have to recharge the remote controls
yet at the same time
that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost
so you would have a docking bays
um
then again that cost as well
um
so those new within the last twenty years have you had with the touch screen
yeah
okay let's include flowing backwards implement this
yeah and must be buying if we tell them to well i i don't think yeah i guess anybody buying a lab uh remote control that we have to plug in so we have to see some kind of new battery technology okay so let's go with a um
that's true
with uh you know some kind of your with the with some cutting edge battery technology
three twelve euros
yeah well it it's it's worth looking into if now we can always a faulty just doing uh well presented plastic simple does it you know it's we i mean you can put the big uh i don't know i mean suppose we could put the the basics on the center easiest you know you know people know the channel and volume function from large easy to get at and then the other the other bits and bob generic of romania
um who do it via states okay so look for discrete in the battery
focus is uh
uh presentation
um
let's see uh with this voice recognition option as well
um
just as for the simple functions the um
the on-off
channels
volume right
um
and um
a small picking function even if you get the voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that just uh i guess another infrared signal to the remote control and well should emit some kind of paging just to be a
um right so any comments
hours before we break into
go to the next round of individual work on us
since we're doing uh touch-screen you wanna look into the possibility of people else uh
input different types of schemes for the okay yeah the actual interface part of it
things like that was just gonna be
one touch screen for everybody
interesting yeah
what what would be on the touch screen \'cause you said earlier that we have to
think about company colors and um
a lotta something about it i can't but unless it
we put fashion elektra yeah
what
it's my understanding that if you're gonna do his skin you need to have some way for people to
della import is in the remote controls and cord then yeah
i think perhaps it's too much good idea by yeah i think that that one might might just be um
and just yeah i think that we might just be out of the range for this particular
a p. d. a. would that makes a lot of sense for p. d. n. a.
\'cause you're gonna be using it yeah
connect up things anyway uh
i'm only guessing
i think we should focus a nice black you know a nice interface touch screen
yeah yeah oh i'm i'm in agreement with the wondering how we're gonna get uh
we put fashion into electronics the employee can use a touch-screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone and i'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like walter loading and then he goes away
perhaps it could be like a temporary
um
comes on every time you turn it out of the mess it because it is a bit much to have it like engraved of saturated
yeah i'm looking for a syllable or not maybe have a millisecond there's a tradition sleep yeah
yeah i know i did it seems like it would suffice it just have the are on there
use the thing but but apparently not
okay so on their remote to be happy
see
flashing things accomplished want it
yeah
ready to go
yeah
well fair enough um
and yeah that would help the battery life to it if the remote did you have to press about it for the remote to turn on
then again who wants to turn on a remote control
well you have to do is touch screen uh i'll wake up okay i'll go into that goes on to sleep mode
okay
i like that i like the idea of um
but in the logo in the bloodstream nice
um
um cool so y'all are things before break
alright fair enough
right
sounds good
and i saved a copy of this can scarcely reminders the save a copy of this and the myself do a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference
i put my files in the shared folder and related and
that's fat guys cool
oh
it's
okay
oh
things like that
um listen to
cooperstown
it is very easy
okay all right
i mean just
powerpoint is uh
who
so
oh
right so um
this meeting will be about the conceptual design don't have speech processing or conceptual design is it just something important that we
yeah
um
because it's kind of uh training the abstract into slightly more concrete in this meeting i believe will come to some
final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype
um
right so um
apologies for the last meeting was brought to my attention that i did not make the rules clear enough um so i will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting
but um
there are enough things important time is good
um
so basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time um in gonna go through
i have always got versus
time by me um e_m_l
call it what we know about um
what we discussed in last meeting possible directions
and then we'll make some more decisions on um
basic up for my poor idea
how we want this remote control to look
and work
so
perfect
so without further ado
yeah
we're also first is treated
i'll go first and i didn't
figure way
yeah
it is neither an icon in the wrong handle then it is very good side and a banana
participant two
okay
mister participant two that is the case
yeah okay yes
uh
basically we're gonna have talked about today is um component design
and
spent price-wise tension that we made is somewhat limited as we can do it because of what our manufacturer offers so we
basically what i'm gonna be doing
okay about that
um components of remote control okay recording kind about this program to get into it
what you're telling probably have to reach some conclusions sometime soon
energy source um a manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources
you standard battery
solar cells
i manufacture didn't say anything about with the end so we might have to look if we do go that route we might have to look elsewhere
um and also there's a kinetic energy possibility
basically it's like um
idiap moving the remote which creative energy to keep it
running so that's one possibly but i don't know whether that would be
powerful enough to eliminate a
touching
yeah
um so we have to look into that
um
the case we have a few options
plastic
rubber or what
um
and then as far as the weights shaped we can do
standard one flat which we popped up
two
curved or very sexy double curved
what kind of fitness are we looking at
um
i imagine that we could specify um
i don't see a reason to go outside of that convention of
three or four millimeters
okay
uh
um
the buttons
there are multiple scroll buttons available for manufacture applied
to use those you would have to use more chips
and that would cost
and if we do go with rubber double curved case
um what to use rubber push-buttons
because the other buttons are compatible
um with that
um
and just so no there touch-screen equals
the chips which equals
many here
yeah
please
um
one thing that i notice is that
most remotes operate on the infrared on the infrared part of spectrum so you notice when you push a button about can see it
anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and
and the television can backpack and if you what's record if you make a video recording to actually see a light
uh one thing that i thought might be interesting ways to use
part user visible light current remote just kind of as a fun gimmick
as you can actually see something coming out remotely push it question happy apart inspection that way
damage to human on the uh
you can't
it is an option that we could have that offer on suppress could select like
sure yeah
i'm sure that we can do that
um
the other side is good idea yeah just as a fun
kinetic uh
just says part of it
um
then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use all since the chip
uh we don't have any way around e. t. a. one one eight three five
um findings okay we have very limited by worker and many factors can offer
um
and my question to all of you is
should we look to other manufacturers must make do with what we have available
interest requested channel information
like say shop around that with our time constraints is that really a feasible option yeah
right that's my concern too
um if we do go to the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside
ah
my personal preferences are still like cards on the table
uh i think
we should like a solar battery group
just kind of keep with the environment silly
friendly thing that we have going on
uh i like the idea that visible light signaling something test sets apart
and uh i was thinking about
i was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to see different
taste
so now
so confined by one
style and say some you know sarah
the one if we just go if one is to go over well then
where in the best situation you need
okay
can you marking piloting too
try to see what kind of for lunch clearly
so now the received
it's an option actually there's i've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now
which actually might even come into play
before hand
okay to decide for now
i can't even imagine it's perfect so i guess i make sense reading
yeah i guess so
because i found some interesting things
okay
okay
there are some additional yeah what it to you in it
uh huh right
so
cut market trends
screen
um but the bayes has looking at what's going on the remote control market right now
and what's going on in other design field to see sir what's what's trendy what's new what's happening
um well control right now basically everybody says they want you were fancier more exciting a second isn't boring
normal functional um that we need innovative design options and it needs to be easy user interface
um
the challenge is that current trends right now across the board in fashioning furniture in technology is it a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing and i'm not saying we should have you know timit shaped remote controls or anything but
i think it is possible maybe to use um natural colors like if it is an option that whole organic sleek cleaner
mine thing and maybe some we can look into different skin options for if we can afford this touch plate thing ever touch
face screen
interface um maybe having it uh images it be specific that you could choose your menu bullets to be
it's interesting
they are sort of not being saved by the children that you know what i mean to sort of
and apparently the feel of the next couple years is spongy i not something i i like element definitely is found that if we can get around to getting piling i thought maybe i casing option like at
not like a scheme but like at holder almost if you could do like um other options or board options or something i should have mentioned this um
as far as the rubber that we can use um we can use a rubber
as part of the case or has a consistency those stress balls he
might be nice to either go select
um
yeah so something to sit down for now so overall i think we should stick with what we're finding every is looking for easy use technologically innovative and this fancy new
i think perhaps the double curved thing and maybe there's rubber option is our best way to go for right now
um
interface oh the interface graphics for yeah
um
well i think but then if the touch screen thing is gonna work out for us that's really not an issue
i'd like you to have rubber is here because it's
ten set
my sister being durable or something that you can drop it doesn't matter \'cause so many you go to somebody houses you station super
the controls very true
yeah it with that yeah very much that would have the phones you didn't we could have a duck tape
casing
oh
okay i would think that goes against the whole fancy something new on line and then
and shall go into the kernel like uh
uh
yeah maybe
um
yeah that's what i know
great picture that uh
yeah well
right
yeah
computers are just
one moment please
so into a interface concept
but if it's for user interface design so you never user pays guys is basically aspects of a computer system
that
we can see
we're here
or otherwise uh
perceive
uh commands mechanisms that basically the user uses to control the operating operating system
isn't it a series of the remote controls that are out on the market today
i think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look
yeah
um
so
the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh
concept
uh voice recognition we have we um actually have some new
uh information from where
research design team but uh get to that in a moment
um so occur voice recognition stress up to about eighty speech samples
um and basically record your own verbal labels can connect them to the remote control
now our design team research team has been l. two
uh set up a system in which
uh you can teach their own remote control whisk recognition system
to respond she um
with standard responses like
you could say good morning
uh remote control normal say sexy female voice good morning joe
um
yeah
and in fact we already have this for a coffee maker line
well single people in the uh another group on the remote control decision node
uh-huh um of
another concept is what uh apple has come out with the spinning wheel with uh l. c. display like on the uh ipods which i'm sure most of you know
um i think
then we have the scroll button with the particular push-button yeah like a modern mouse a bit bulky a bit crazy
i don't think that's what we're necessarily going for
and uh some special components uh
ideas like uh blocking having the ability to block channels from you for your children
um
and uh dedicated buttons for
for commonly used uh channels
and even uh ideas like secure hidden programming but uh and again if we go with flip-screen i don't think that's a big issue
um
and uh this is kind of the uh
the big idea about uh uh uh at
uh the jumble universal remote control is almost impossible the misplaced easier to see them
uh
again probably not what we're going for so i mean my ideas here and kind of where i think we're heading is something slightly larger the regular ipod
uh with a hard plastic uh plastic casing although i think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas
uh change or casings and the
our design team was possibly talking about including one extra faceplate with the package kind of
so the idea that you can change it and you can try changing you kinda get used to it
thinking about maybe buying another one which and
add value to uh
bottom line
uh touch-screen brave
um possibly having go to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen
uh the important ones like power volume and job between channels
um and of course her voice command system which are talked a little bit about already
and uh the use of recognizable colors interested in recognition of the features uh
that are around so
read for power
um you areas for
different
volume up some down some channels have some doubts about that
and uh perhaps even adding in some
stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like
for
for instance my toast you make it and i got from the bank
has jokes when it's ready
yeah
yeah it is
great and uh
that is about it
mainly for run
cool
yeah
might have good ideas
good facts to have
okay
yeah
add to the needs a compliment on logistics of this for it is enough to stand up again
uh huh
a kid
right so
it and all that stuff thanks guys um
no kind of to come to some decisions um
i think we can just go to line all three of those which have uh
um
based on what
and even presented as far as the um
yeah
there is
costs and benefits
um
i think i don't know what you guys think about the touch screen at this point
i think is the most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places
okay
uh can only
really afford it \'cause it looks like they would be that would be a really in maine
cost
it's worse than right
my s. and that is that there is to incorporate touch-screen technologies gonna causes upwards of
seventeen fifty
your
to present them and yeah that's just niceties
well you guys are always the damper is on this um okay you industrial design i yeah
it's in the end our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty
uh i mean i thought there was some flexibility with that
okay
there is it's just it is nationally justify and how much you know it is i mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money
um from twelve fifty if we do want to get a fifty or a hundred percent profit margin
um that would mean selling it for twenty five she multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five
right
so
where you guys come up with these numbers
which stuff atop my head
it is pending further emails
yeah but from the moment break um
well
do i think that's what people would pay for i mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote you can expect to do something
that's true isn't it would be in a class of john
yeah
and that's to be fairly um
the percent of the market we're not going for mass in a in a manner sales anyway we're going to make
i mean what we're not talking about selling easily and of these things we just couldn't number twenty five euros so
we could probably maybe shrink the profit margin rather sell it for twenty five sell for thirty but that's something we can find it still with new um
i say that we
provision that go with the transcriber
where were you what would you have done better on
i'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and i also think that we can probably come up with some sort of energy per uh
i mean stick to go about this kind of production line corners might even the uh on the third floor suggested to them
well we can look at this other manufacturing option you wouldn't get him somewhere else cheaper um
it's true
but we could not
initially go with what we have
and if we can find a starting point anyway so
and we have this very simple touch screen you know there's always the opportunity that it's gonna be about the size of the ipod or whatever
yeah well yeah i guess we can play around the feel of it i let's say that okay so the test will be our
um
our main selling point here
i think that we really have two main selling point is a close race engine and the voice recognition really is pretty
bells and whistles color lower yeah the voice rec thing i mean
if if we're looking at
bottom alone
now we're looking up in the casa seventeen to get touch screen i think we might have to drop
voice right i think we have to decide between yeah definitely yeah to be asked we have the cable we have the design in house i mean we've we've come up with this
what is new ways we're using it for a coffee machines already
i can pass it on an email from my uh guy and uh
guy down the hall
sounds good
caruso
what do you think that anything about the voice rec
i think if we
we do both the obvious impression cross trying to get help
by it
despite into
become the rolls royce of remote controls but square
pretty much
very nice
i mean we we have period reflect back on what our market research survey and they said they wanted voice recognition
course maybe hadn't thought of that school touch screen option but
definitely we know what the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell
is a call i don't think i can give rise up so like really i can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know
yeah
does having both really upper class
i can see how wouldn't i mean
as you will average them you can have a fast you can have a cheap you can have it
quality
pick two or three
you know you can't you can't have often yeah
\'cause you use having number of chips we need to deal with each
the function
well if we're gonna give it to the right so we have to pick between one of material
um
well
otherwise yeah we just it just becomes cost prohibitive quite which which we suspect
we should all we should hold on to
well we already have research backing voice recognition
as you know
physically solid
well by that
i i
i personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell i think that's all we need to go with the new we can table this touch screen
for our next model
i would have to side with that i think so
the voice recognition is simple we already have the
all the technology analysis ready to go it's packaged it's
what is the cost look like one is cheaper to do the v. r. to do the uh touch screen
method
well my point
um
it's just off the top of my head
keep in mind
but
i think
the voice recognition with
that was it
um
they're both going to
push the cost up
but um
since we already have the technology and has for the voice recognition
right and had to do this much
design work and sometimes design work as well pushed herself
right
can any
yep we have to you uh lost and we're still that that we have to do with this battery issue nearly as much either we can stick with what we've already got
in a lot of ways to
okay so i'm getting
alright so more or less you guys think that that other till then the voice recognition will be better
i think it's a lower risk option would yeah right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in our best option
okay sorry
you will need the touch-screen in favor of voice recognition
it's you and me and settle
so and when are we gonna have basic
prototypes coming up next that's you guys next step right yeah well we're circle sort out what it what in
what else we're gonna talk about one hundred temper yeah that's the next step to develop what are we going to talk now about um the materials arrangements can is just run through it yeah okay yeah um
you discussed either a lithium or a solar power with the solar power be enough to
fuel a voice recognition of this killer static one it would that be enough to feel a voice recognition remote animal
the solar power definitely would be by
i think
just keep people from getting annoyed \'cause sometimes all of our fellows just another round that we should
install a small backup battery
hm
yeah
just to come in those moments when
for whatever reason the remote hasn't works best in t_v in a basement
my wife
yeah we're we can't guarantee summit everywhere so having it should resources probably the worst not the same as the solar power
calculator and you know how those does not really require that much why
chairman
um obviously a little more light than calculator but we're not talking about
a white light does have to be
out
taking some path yeah
for understanding
okay
we think on
i'm willing to agree with everything that's been said
uh i have to say though that um
and other ideas come up my if we're really not uh handling the
remote control to a great extent
we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control
and maybe kind of have
around
remote control that kind of looks like a paper weight or something like that
kind of a sweet little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something
interesting
yeah that's the thought why moving away from handheld why
let's see
well if you don't need to pick it up
it could kinda use got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job
do you think people there
people are by um are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition search or something
it is sometimes be true and it
problem i think we're being and selling it to more than just
voice recognition people like we want it to work and fundamentally we have is limited to as well right
but that's done that's no bother i mean if you look at the catalog from
places like a sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um
but is it apple makes these really
pretentious speakers with a sub woofers and like clear in class and you know when we got a little true middle type of um splinters i mean why not have a little more rounded kind of thing it could still have the basic buttons on it
um
\'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well
with the but yeah
and maybe a menu button and so forth you know on the user channel button to scroll through the menu if they want to record programs or whatever you know because i think it on something yes
we need to escape the traditional or shape of
remote
maybe something that looks nice and the tables would be okay even though and handled the same time
i think it's all about
following apples week
oh i wanna be i'm thinking of the airport moral you know like that at all
part little ones right
yeah i mean unless although we do um oh as i recall english you mentioned we need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminum thing and get back to it but you can have a very tasteful um
well in colorado told i have um
tariq on a bowl or something
still i mean yeah along those lines yeah i like that i like that idea life um
let's see we can do as far as that goes okay and the other material like the plastics and so forth we were discussing that being i usually make a rubber kind of
softer feel um uh you know i work for further input to gonna spend this bit
gives just yet
yeah you know something where
it's uh a more advanced from of plastic would have some kind of a
tactile response to it
right
just kind of the squishy feel
yeah
which is the next big thing so
one or anything okay
um
yeah it's if you can do it squishy no and remote control looking remote control but to be very i mean just you could just put it literally put it on the
uh like the coffee table next to the telly insane by my own
one thing
i like and i like the idea that's good
uh we sort of discussed costs
um
i guess what that's gonna be uh i think if we were a bit over budget it might be okay
sorry about the uh lack of information costas haven't been provided that finish by manufacturers
well i was under the data set
no more than one more than i do
um
no just yeah go from there
um
so if we visited the touch screen in more or less will that out um i think so were more or less can we what we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um
a simple kind of function
you know not
too complex right
well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis
although i'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions they should be secondary
at least if not functioning then visually like those shouldn't be
right
like many and many residents
if you if we're not going to touch screen route then we can um
just incorporate maybe
something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds remotes is the most basic functions up here in something that slides down to
the on the more complex
just
yeah well do you wanna consider like an ipod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through a menu options
in
then we're in a cost issue natural we also have them them at the thing uh for for gonna have a normal remote looking remote
two how do we
yeah
fair enough
but no i mean we could use slider compartment you know like if it's a it's a little vaguely ovoid type thing and easy to have a compartment in there or you know about but a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then assigns up-and-down type thing like on huh
but only the need later
yeah multimedia players we just have
um
a menu button on the side and then gets all around the meanings kind of
yeah and you have to me like that
so we go are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons appointees are going to use scroll buttons
rubber buttons
well it seems like
there it seems to me that we can just do the and
stick with the rubber
\'cause we're probably gonna be using some kind of
um
rubber for the outside case and others have stick with that right
thing to a certain extent we have to stick with uh
kind of it a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then
and then make a unique feature casing and want to and her voice command
well those basic just like for directions that are they can use as a menu or channel and volume or however you want to do it are really versatile and
every already got them to some extent almost thirty own so it's not like we're dealing with every re learning things \'cause
that's that so many ways to one ninety four
right
okay
um
we've already kind of covered this as well
seems to be selling um number of more or less clear that would occur
target this youth market
who
um
especially now with
it's a thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population particular in technological field so um
hm to decorate it okay
um
yeah alright well most cover what we need to cover thing found in the in the final thoughts before we think about didn't we parted i'm not a prototype
well what are we actually doing
oh right i was just gonna step on to um
uh
oh i wasn't in a way that wasn't though about that
um
sorry
yeah alright
the um yeah okay i was gonna assign tasks in the next unit if any any other final thoughts before we go ahead and
cool
so have we say that we are gonna go with
different style cases for different people
well we're just going to go with one
it's very it's very important to predict because
you have different cases that might help remarkable that obviously
we have
just one case and it doesn't go over well
yeah it's a strange body having marcus also cost wise
well then again colors wouldn't be so hard to do you can uh or something
i you know i have a kind of an actual what color like a stinging uh it
handheld
all the green or something it telling you so much of a problem to incorporate into the color of the rubber i don't think
and again copying i max kind of for ipod
mac apple certainly a color scheme
yeah totally
yeah i think that's probably good okay so let's work on it
um multiple
case colors
but yeah stick with the same kind of
current
yeah the same basically non remote kind of remote design
cool
alright so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour
um
would the uh uh like my father like you to work on just the basic look and feel what can we accomplish
um
given these parameters we sort of sorted out this kind of uh
no remote remote
but um
so what are broad constraints before we developed design a prototype
and um well if you get it
figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of the simple design with the voice recognition delta and and also this
kind of drop down
or
it's on the side kind of menu options are simple
so now working out how we can get dissolves in the same place
um
and you can check product evaluation in some
pilots are stuff i need you guys to work together and making a prototype
um
i'm using
uh
prototype building material
um
and also um specific instructions will be sent email you coaches as marks so that's a start with your hands that right now has to include says goodbye wheels
alright
it's just it detects text gasp
cool
okay
yeah
question
eligible lists
yeah so maybe just a little bit means
chances are
three for this one
okay
all set up
cool
alright it is powerpoint time
i don't more powerpoints in this particular experiment
i've ever done in my life before disappearing
this component
yeah
so uh here we have our detailed design meeting and where we will um
look at the prototype
and um
right so um
i finally figured out what this whole second both ways about in my that my coach was thirty thirty minutes i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous me oh really okay i think oh
i don't know
otherwise it just saying i mean the secretary and then
therefore taking the instance itself
just to go uh huh
just real briefly go over minutes from last meeting
uh i will open up down slowly
no
right right
wait for it
tsk tsk
sh uh
yeah that's
yeah you know
this uh like
this
this is this is a very
high-powered stuff yeah
that look like a very got
so um basically the more the store from our last the uh last meeting was that
family
there we had meetings from uh we had presentations them by the industrial designer will for making the wrong end of sarah about what we can do here
um in what
sort of limitations are operating with
um
i just utilities are operating under
what kind of risk would be looking at what some of the various approaches we were discussing
and we essentially in the conclusion that we should
develop a remote with their voice recognition either had a vaguely non remote like shape um because you didn't really use it as a remotes as you could just use your voice
uh would includes um
mostly just a simple design features for television operation
but with a slider fold out the for more advanced functions for users
um and uh the uh
uh the u. i. d. and the idea were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at
so
that's already back to the main
me here um
go ahead and particularly as
well
um
we have sampled ah
prototype um
what's we said about it
um
we take into account a lot of things that we went over in the last meeting uh
so the most important things to consider that it's
we had decided not to go for the touch screen which can save you
and opted for some
very
barge
buttons for the
primary
functions
um
this is going to be the on off button and then we have
these binds to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here
that we sent those with the most important
uh buttons
and then
for the more advanced
uh functions there's a slide uh
panel here
um
you can see that talents for the things going on
but this actually can side back in
pride very nice a static wouldn't stop either way
um
as far as the uh call this white thing we decided to go in uh what's what colors uh one high level
of course that's annoying for some people a function
can be trained on perfect
um
no it's important to you we talked quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh
faces
and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural if you
mainly because
fruity
i haven't read it
okay
um of course that's uh interchange wanted uh
i think it would be desirable for the uh
for the regular product in the in the in the
in the first packaging could be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done is yeah
um and as you can see on the television there
now we have the uh voice detector device how uh
also something
uh huh
uh me
so that that will work quite well with
with regard to find in this uh
contraption
um
what other things we see here well um if you give it a touch it does have a actually a bit of a spongy feel
um and so i think that will work well regarded sir market is um
and uh
let's see well clearly there's gonna be some more colors and what not available
um
do you have anything else in there
um
uh what about the materials it is
uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coding
so it's very
durable
uh it's not gonna
break like sometimes a plastic construct
uh
of course as you can see if you touch it does happen that's squishy
it's actually important to know that the television
uh huh
yeah if there's an earthquake or anything like that
it it actually is a double instead
yeah
i i i i i think there is but i wrote the yeah
the company's name
oh well uh
uh this uh this is actually
an apple inside
give me the story about um brought factor
um but
it's encased in a new uh
take a
um okay is preserved and moaning
you can either have or something you're not talking about making television station available to new sources of wave of the future
fair comparison off at least
a possible name on it
um
but i think that's uh i think that sums up the main features are of the remote i don't know if you guys have any questions or whether it's than uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything
the
nature um did we come in under budget
i would to
yeah this costs well to put this into um production
looking about
with our uh coast twelve
fifty euro
um in this guy actually can then uh eleven ninety nine
so i was quite pleased with the
um
one thing that we didn't allow
obviously we have a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons but we just one for classic
rubber button
and um
since we did that
we have to use as many microchips just quite nice that's well keep the cost down below
so has a lot of
modern
technology
um for example the voice recognition by ways is just a simple
oh
down
i think
if we shopped around for other manufacturers
um
we might be able to
getting cheaper
oh
do we talk about the words
recognition uh option
oh no we haven't also um
so uh on the back you will notice this
yeah here which is actually the voice recognition
okay
uh console
and uh
i think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look
um other but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest design sorta research you must be another couple come up with basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker
um design that we're talking about are different
i think that uh he's given a proven
uh
ease of use and what not
yeah
and uh
allows features
like
the remote actually talking back to the user here
cool questions
no doesn't do anything that's do we have um other
five letter words gains covers
in plain our those gonna be developed later once we see how the cup we have go or on
finishes denomination
well we didn't quite have enough which we'll uh
always exciting apart and i don't you guys handyman right
um
what
as you can see this is just the most superficial way
and um
be very easy to okay
put another way or just
or something else like that
okay actually this bottom red ring here are just some clips
and then you poems and then you've been hearing okay
and you
plate on top of that so i mean there are are we definitely yeah priced out uh spongy even spongy or
non natural look on materials which i think worked out fine we also continued on with the ideas of blah following
uh apples color schemes
with kind of the oddball later orange and signing in
it's not quite a a faceplate it's more like a studio faceplate
okay guys
it's simple enough that
and the factory \'kay
we could very easily quite different on it it
once in place such the
yeah it's pretty
permanent
the same time
if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments we could go yeah the faceplate way if you know any yep
it still optional yeah you know very cool
just tap
right here thanks guys as
very very good work like it
really it
um
what we need to discuss now is the finance of it um i got me you've got
deep-fried it it and number that actually sounds quite nice um
the trouble is i just given this by frame it's parameter spreadsheet the parts you have just
tentatively put in what it's going to look like
um i'm just gonna clear this out real quickly
but it looks like
so we just
if we can just i am i is what's in here we've got this it's a solar cell thing right
right said with a bag of battery but it it's in there yeah with the back okay
um yeah it's recognition are actually doubles is uh
as the source filter clever clever well then
um so i guess i let me look at a bit of a um
it's uh sit there speaker in a sense at the same time isn't it
yeah
it's just making use the same space seem to case but
um in that case it's more of a single curved case i guess would be that the the general yeah one baby curve is considered
um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout
um
push-button interface
um with this other drop down so maybe we've got to push button interface is the way
um
yeah and um special
i guess is the we've got out server would material or rubbery type material
yeah discussion throughout yes i guess you have to mark special color special forms well
and she because it is very and convention yeah it's another unix i like it yes
so it looks like
it can it sixteen a bit over budget
um regions
so what we could do perhaps
a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells
um or take out the back up battery
useful
i mean i think that uh if we're talking about it being wanna remain selling features being experimental with uh this one
although it does still have the batteries i'm not sure that
you know what the sellers on the i mean we could take
we take the battery out in the d. c. any probably work point nine eight percent time by
you have to separate
call center for that one percent time
people call
it's hard work
my remote is working women in their opinion people are upset
i think in one run it's better to keep the battery
instruct scrap the whole solitary idea because that's
seven table to
the thing that we had
um
what's difficult we have all these things integral to the um
to the design of it that we just can't back out of and uh have to be
it seems like we have to go back to uh
square one
in a way
um if we're gonna try to
and do one bit we probably have to do most definitely
yeah um
although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental
i mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way you work in this is like a natural new
thing
but honestly if we cut that one piece our actually communion budget effect i mean that's quite right
yeah i mean you this way we on the idea that
we are the main selling point could be already this ways recognition thing i mean which is that it's sorry yeah that's what sending us into this young market now to we started from cell
i don't know and i mean you know perhaps when the sun technology comes down in price we can bring that back in the beginning but it looks like at this point that maybe out of our league
the reality is
you know
probably from an ideological standpoint i'd like to stick with the uh
the solar cell but
i kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model yeah
and uh
you know i think either or
i think that i think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project
with the solar cell
yeah i think that's for sure that's a best option so i we were gonna
get below
uh holds no
twelve fifty
\'cause we can't remove the push-buttons \'cause
they are typically hit kind of um
yeah i can't get rid of
yeah i mean
removing the
changing the case wouldn't be so much of the
so there is um
um no we're changing the case materials
um
so yeah it looks like to be the only thing
yeah so that would be it's a major change but
yeah
right
so or agreement on that
i portion i think we are
i think that was a good compromise your preference
right
moving along swiftly um so i guess now we just go to
the project evaluation
which i will allow
conservative they'll be me
um
cord oh of course sorry no problem
you each it'll be great
thank you
if adequate
okay i'm glad that you do that on purpose later
okay um basically i was just evaluating that um
from what we know of our product working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of each the things we need to do these the things that look like we feel are important
um so i was looking at basic design things does have a filter function does a remote is the design what we wanted to do it our technologies up to where we hope they would be and is a fully extended qualities that our original market research was looking for
um
basic questions like you know does it turn on doesn't respond to voice recognition and overall in general it looks like it's coming up to par um the only thing is with with the p_l_p panel that is gonna take some adjusting because in user interface
um
that looked like it was coming up graph but then once you get used to it it does make a lot of sense so i think overall we have in the right direction
yeah
cell
like that spongy feel
yeah uh it looks like it's gone almost sounds mostly works well that's good to hear very good handle on yeah
it's i think eventually if we do um branch out despite mean we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms house and stuff but for now all the guys working in range we needed for sound
it's all good
there are many and then just point me losing the so um yeah et cetera
yeah
it is a setback but
okay t_d quebec um yeah which we might have lost like a normal activity
but the man
oh they don't always anyway
i think she's true
yeah
right so um
this one's a bit and clear to me to be perfect
fair um
i got this slide
from the college
yeah and then she went connected to
um
so i guess we are going to discuss
um
and my project process
um
and that is going to go into my report so i guess this is the point where we go um
uh out
overall
it looks like and talk about
i satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth
and okay
have it all worked i guess
as in within the team building so yeah right so it's just kind of a
i think it's an mike kind of thing the thing i think so
it is now with your design
there you go
on the screen or picks it up
they just issue a job and if i would say okay yeah yeah there um
right
um
so any thoughts
we can say these points here
yeah okay starting box yeah
when you get available for process
this
oh you know i think in general for a day's worth of work we actually give relatively productive considering the little amount of input we had going in
um
um and the technology is definitely gonna help it's really interesting to try out all this stuff
when in use the whiteboard flow
no we're going towards we could now if an account for uh really if
yeah i did you guys have been designing in here perhaps of a change but because of
prove constraint doesn't really matter
uh also
had i not been intrigued about the pen i don't think i would use digital
i don't write earlier yeah i think they're seeking notes more often than usual this can yeah that's true
um
was pretty compact though
no one
i am disappointed in getting back to my personal coach
the visual personal coach yeah i mean i think there's times
yeah
yeah but look if if anything let's see if you get a response two or three months
but
yeah forget it would be kinda great easier to contact coach anything like that i can walk encouraging is that really what if they really need it okay
yeah
it's like and i think there is a lot of room for creativity we can do you ever
they think is no longer in tilde
project came down on us
um
and even then we did get it these in product and i hope although it's not everything we wanted it to be
yeah with the natural look
it's
yeah organic regular yeah it's because it had with the aquila and here's something i highly resourceful teammates might i add with you always have class
yeah i think you have read that are like really creative actually i mean yeah uh i'm impressed
the teamwork was good
to prove that we were always full we didn't waste a single bit of play that we use every day
yeah he's
all for those little contain because yeah we've been learning is the multi colored away altogether involuntary systems that we didn't have enough colors to work with
click
and therefore it back yeah
because you begin l. multiple since it really had been water like uh missing
oh well
what do you guys think about there there there were holes
um
they look good
yeah it's fun kind of fun
yeah
it was
i think it's pretty clever as we're never able to get it
too far
off track
because
the information came at the right time
to kind of fill in the gaps enough
the same time we had enough room to kind of
just make things i do you will just go
so if you feel like the the level information dropped off severely over the course of okay
yeah
i mean maybe it's just me but i didn't actually get him for fiction this presentation at all
they still nothing without displaying any number
like a visit
so yeah i feel like that was that i can but then you know
fill in the blanks on your own level of creativity out
well i think that was i think that was an issue i kept finding with regard to what to do well no but also yeah well when i was reporting about what each of us is doing is bombing give users to what you're doing
in as much involvement and then i also felt like
you know a lot of our discussion will center around
the specifically what my task was because that was kind of interface where you know just what yes the whole project was about
um not very much so
but and then in the end i think or tell to kind of material yeah
that's fine
what is what
the most helpful thing
and that everything
was getting there
the powerpoint slides already
put together when you save greyhound um it's just okay i got all that done
time
very much so
cool
yeah i think your leadership was quite good
it was from
she said i i did she actually the common often avoid getting in the same way that is true when we get back i feel like i got way too into it
that's kind of it with our slogan l. y.
give the rest of us the structure work with sign
there so that the person i mean taking on like in a row
for some of everything like yeah project project management page you organize crap is one thing that you you know sever party with your friends yeah i know yeah
joseph
but you can still that you can keep
the
yeah uh suspension of disbelief kind of like like that we wanna yeah
x. if a couple moments were just kind of here maybe we were a little high for exceed
oh yeah and i i do business with but it
i mean this is we got the play-doh
but uh i only imagine
yeah
you know the whole concept are really trying to stick with reality went out the window to make that happen in it
maybe i'd like us you know
possible willingness to like make a remote control
or spatial appreciative spaceship like us jasmine's build speech coding like that yeah everybody knows totally that species either
um you guys feel like there's a teamwork problem
yeah long so
oh
yeah
right
thank you
no i don't know i d. i don't know i don't i i was just
no i didn't actually i mean other than my discussion meetings there wasn't except for the actual building
yeah
but strictly like if this was a team project i should have been
much more declarative like brainstorming use the board
well this would have been six months worth of work or not
yeah three numbers were two meetings
i mean i think had there should be more serious about whether brainstorm or during meetings this year
yeah
\'cause i'm not conscious of the idea of
the project manager asking
yeah you guys feel like there's a team
yeah it's kind of like
like uh
he'd be in those kind of
uh yeah
interesting
kind of a something with it
and the whole process of wonder why is there anything about the way we got so much from it was like at this point to the
the board
i don't know i i dunno if there was ever minus the mikes i don't feel like getting up or down doing with all these wires i was afraid as accessing
yeah my so lucent
a gender gap it's
so most body sending them or something contain water
yeah i don't know what i would have shown on the board
true but it didn't even occur to me as an option i mean i don't know but i'm whatever but i know that i consciously didn't
i mean it's just like the paper i don't know what i really need the paper for
true
um
because they've got this last time
yeah
senator i just use it because it's literally right in front me
you always have the output files liberties um from the digital paper until my my handwriting looks like digitize because many score
wrap
yeah
i mean this is still looks like in
p. d. f.
format or something
usually i would do a lot we're dealing too but i know i felt like i needed professional sufficiently trauma manager and stuff
okay but not entirely
but step unsuitable it's designed initially to get
i am curious about what the de briefing is gonna be like you know like what is the uh
what exactly we're looking for here
so sorely needed to
i don't know i'm not sure the new ideas found
there is a bounty s.
it did he just say newman that we need to discuss that
well
that's the thing i got in the email i got this powerpoint file but this slide was
yes i did was like that in
i didn't changes when locking
well i'm just wondering track
um well
any new ideas with regard to
with her control console okay now
i'm kinda like well i think they still do their job
yeah you define as i am thinking outside the little square box that will
but literally
uh in like for them
i noticed a circle behind yeah
this can make you wonder i mean
how much can you do with the remote control
taking making any color
yeah yeah you gotta technically car shape working on round yeah
i don't know
huh
um okay in the kinds of this as the back-end uh
i don't know
i think this is well how long was i supposed to me how much time before you shout out and i think we should go on a bit yeah but the project eval um
i don't but you have but i felt like
a bit
linda stimulated on the whole thing
like what like you know what am i really doing
you know what is
yeah at the beginning it started out that they'll actually like under pressure like the first couple yeah checking out of work and i was like they had like all these brainstorming i was doing and then suddenly as well as just another to my presentation that you guys really care motorized uh
uh yeah definitely you know they mean like we also yeah we read it with it so it didn't feel
definitely a matter when i first thought of the
questionnaires marking up i higher in terms of how much i had to how much i stressed of right by the time it that's the last
when average in at
because also realization of
we
basically just copy and paste what's given to you and your does she and
which uh
wasn't so clear to me that he and
i actually didn't do that although every single one it all the presentations either added slides or adding them
oh i added like five slides yeah we got like ones
i just got like ones that really my size world like they have a title maybe a multi never just empty which you do not have it in like a man yeah they didn't come like this like with
this is well it's like this is another area that really just over there
in one way you're always looking so more
computation for her
that's needed slides in
yeah
i think at the side one time
how many flights every time in in w. background image of a thousand people ask last time on
i expect
oh yeah
any other thoughts come to mind
so we know how project for
here
i can't easily fail
leveraging extension socialist like that or netscape and along with it at one hundred eighty nine if we skeptical it might be an elderly and even you would be that we kind of decided to look over like
face
it didn't occur when this happened fancy actually that looked a lot more like a time before previous to uh
can build other design um
modifications
normally
i hope you appreciate the incorporation of some tin foil from a yeah i
random kitty-cat point that can be consumed by accident
i'm just saying
well huh
interesting though the k_l uh you know it's it's um
so again i reiterate mike
question
how different we are
compared to the other groups especially between culture
oops i do know
the um
it's almost everything for pretty logically
you know from there
the basics to the console up the whole concept saying that all concepts phase i don't think i really
and you still like the concept
well actually i did okay good notion of functional i don't yeah i mean it's not like i have a concept of a monster material is just now
it is it's
yeah you know maybe you
well then concept should be should be thought we should i i thought i thought rather than in terms of concept i thought of it in terms of um
like
to propose
idea
and then the final would be like the the actual specify prototype or whatever i don't know
uh
oh can i just say
so we have more slides
no just this closing one
we have established that the cards were really within budget that we could
it's you know we've got it to me
we do any project evaluation based on their um
et cetera it's evaluation of
also with all these really technically
and evaluation of the product not the project
in general um which i'm not sure is the same thing at the time that just it made more sense but
i could see if they really asking about
oh nice
yeah
because we did we had if i think about it um
yeah
it's all recorded um yeah well though but um
we're supposed to do this final report thing in the end so i'll put all that into the final report as well as much as
seems like
maybe not like the articles and stuff like because it if and so forth but optimistically elements
it be so meetings and a copy of the recording
uh i had done i
huh
i don't transcription for and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like
just another centers like that that mean nothing
the whole browser psychology or whatever that psycholinguistics
well the other testimony here yeah he still equals announces or something yeah
the call the disfluencies disfluencies at a good word for it
yeah we like our katie
phrases and jewelers we just had to prefix is sounds class here exactly
i will save this into the
for your family citing the send receive button on the
no i just uh yeah i can also relate to it
i like some yeah
currently some information about that if there were put the world on the internet
yeah so we don't we are addicts
that's scarier
it is very easy i'll just throw on that you know we with the first ten fifteen years of our lives without the internet
it's only allows ten the whiteboard here yet
i mean there or just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight modems to broadband all the time
in training we had the internet for like eighteen years
no we yeah but i know in the sense it's so you know it's not right in my group here and telling me these and i got it ninety four
let's tell it's crazy
yeah so
in the eighties
my um grammar does computer science back in the states and so they had um n. e. d. u. and got network um there's basically the fundamental structures but it wasn't
uh helpful household yet because it hadn't been
yeah it was to the complexity now resides or something yeah
as you know
you guys are there to celebrate
yeah i thought was it does that include like a very ingenious thing uh
sure
i used to have probably call them into it and
i mean does it closer
oh forty minutes or
that's going on
that's alright yeah
yeah
yeah
i am going to get
so the only song yeah
who's another one
this is windows media player
uh-huh yeah
oh also
i believe onto the i thought it was the eva is looking really i hope that's what it seems to be shipping with a fellowship with for only the the new version
so that close yeah i guess we'll call that again ever
and the meeting
uh
they can read
you can get exciting
yeah
yeah
like propose criteria
yeah
um
my personal
okay okay everybody ready
shape so uh i think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves
yeah that's a guy and um his name and what your function is so maybe you instantly feel
yeah my name is fans or not
and i and uh and user interface made all this
uh the
the main responsibilities you said interface um and my role is to design uh uh
television remote control huh
okay
uh and i'm the marketing person uh uh one figure out how to sell
huh and your name is my name's eileen
okay
yeah uh i'm genevieve um um my oldest industrial designer
and my responsibilities are are
uh
uh
a deal with the technical functional design and the specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design
any good
and as you or you know i'm betsy i'm the project manager for today
so when we look at the presentation that
to see what we really are supposed to do
okay
yes the opening acquaintance
tool training while
the tools
uh i think we already
i guess the tool is really out of the computer um as far as i can see
um we get in each of us will get instructions and we'll take it
from there
project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much uh um i don't think we have any great discussion at this point
yeah
um
here is what existing should be
the same year when
uh
uh design always in the remote control
i threw people regional
um trendy
and of course user
right
yeah
so maybe i'll make some notes of that
okay
right
here is what the functional design
he's supposed to achieve
uh
that is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss
what
uh
we have come up with
the same goes for the conceptual design
there will be individual work
and then discussion afterwards
detailed design
same thing
three different types of design company concern
hm
um
i k. i. system
maybe we should redesign
but it's not
yes
to finish the remote control data
right
then tool training tried the whiteboard
but to control their favorite animal
does anybody want to go and
see how the whiteboard works
so that
t. in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard
you wanna go highly man
the pale silicon there
whether you
without changing your stuff
since i remember how to
draw kitty-cat or parameters
but
and remember you have to press so it works as a man
oh
that fact that i think i
verify
yeah yeah
six five
okay okay
and you were
front seem nice i mean yeah i mean like just to see and hear how it feels so that you have a little idea
um i was aware of
i don't know
no that's okay
get to that later
okay
so that uh
yeah
this means acting aggressively
oh yeah
i don't think you together in groups are like this
yeah
yeah
is the project finance uh which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing
um selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro
um profit aim for the company is fifty million euro
market range unlimited
the meeting international
okay
and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve
fifty euro
okay and that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged no
in
so these are holding the things of course
to remember is a budget and when you design
two
materials cost et cetera
now
uh discussion i guess it is
um
does any one of you have experience with
remote control
yeah it was
as it is even the user we use them right every day
uh and uh
now
having used in the remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea
like things you did like with its things you would like to change things we'd like to improve with this thing yeah i d. first ideas
i could be smaller
bigger
yeah i have more buttons on it or or maybe clearly better marked
but um you know things like that
yeah i i feel that the remote should be very come back to smaller right those which we get yeah nowadays it's very long
um and um
and it should have multiple up as like at that remote control materials but the way it should uh it should be used for uh for some other purpose also like
controlling uh uh decoration inside the house of it at condition as of a heating system so it should be a multi function all
uh a gadget is that it was uh control your household uh machines basically exactly
well the term
twelve
fifty euros
for
well
well you know as we get a really good so maybe we can do that
we certainly can turn to a group of it to market something successfully should do some more it should be something new should be if it should do something different then then just folded happy now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design yeah design should be yeah i should be displayed on the almost like a train you know like another thirty every so maybe to be something trendy you know maybe in different colors or materials so our you know
um so yeah shapes right you know like keep the shape file better in your hand or something else in terms of shape yeah
that would help
i think another thing that would help is always
if
it
beeps when you clap
because i think one of the big things that happens is able to use them they can't find it
that is true
they put a newspaper or they put it behind a planet or we or whatever and and there are some in the phone rings and they want to turn the t_v off and see why
place
my remote control yeah
well or yeah or if it's really
if it's really a dark spot
that he keeps out that uh sounds or signals and yeah definitely to tell you last slide should be when you lost uh signal is it me or so it was signal you know and and maybe to have a light so that we can
we can just recognize abilities
exactly i mean just the as as i say i'm just saying zero signal meaning just whether it's uh feeble whether the light emitting selected group
um
clue for the is the
it would respond to
p_l_p
or respond
to your voice
or would respond what would you do have to do to make it beep or point okay my my idea is maybe that
the minute it's really hidden in in other words if it's
like
in a dark spot
to um
uh meaning you know like newspaper is on top a sweater is on top or it's it's behind the plan
at that moment it's it's like it's like uh um what you call it the light set the sensors you know oh in in that mode it has a sensor if it gets a certain darkness
it has a sensor and it gives out a signal
whether that be a light signal or a beep i mean that we can discuss this later you know
and so there were times where
activate the signal that's right and you know it would be
right you have to have some kind of sensor
and i i think he uh voice or clapping that's not specific enough
uh i know they're the lambs and stuff you know you can live on and off
but i think the only work
to certain degree
it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find
what was it in
well because this is because you silly because people is oh yeah well but then those you can help by everybody
like on top of your bookcase and usually kept it on the coffee table
uh
you know but we had we had to move along i mean it will but i think we have some good good points to start with him
okay the next meeting will be in thirty minutes i think you're old did you get the notices on your computer this okay so well that the note is um
uh
the working design
i guess that's the function i d.
uh we says the industrial designer
yeah
that's true
yeah its functionality yeah exactly okay so
we are looking for working design when we come back
uh looking nice and yeah it sounded
note the functional design and then the technical functions you the technical functions those and so you are the working design so you're working design
and then he functional design
and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirements specification like frame
yes and what we just discussed in general
that would be your
idea
and of course price
but they said that the price is a good price um i mean the prices given but
the that was
we have to justify that that's right uh having sufficient features to make it so that that's right
and you know this but you you will get specific yeah
instructions for that i think that's the end of the show
so uh um
we have well we have a
fine
two two two three minutes
um any questions at this point or uh
suggestions
um i think basically
basically you will get instructions
to work with
and if you have any questions or
okay supreme
okay i think i have
to think about our next meeting
um
in order to people yeah islamic yeah
okay
right well observations
then uh i see you in about thirty minutes
and see what we can come up with um okay really
okay yeah
so many of your uh
typically this now i think we have to keep it yet
i see
yeah
okay
okay
yeah
people
yeah
simply ready for
just uh this is it
um
okay
um
i take it you'll have
received instructions as to what
more specifically
and
uh and
i finished the marketing manager progress report
first
addressing the needs and desires
okay register now
yeah um
okay i'll put you on with my slides up \'cause i think it might be helpful and uh we looked at the slides at the same time okay
participant four percent for every
please um
okay well i think there's
and introduced ourselves so the functional requirements uh
it is
is board michael but whatever pastor to the second slide
because that's where my discussion starts by well um since i'm in charge of trying to figure out what
we should put on these things as i have to try to sell it
um i thought that they method i should follow each other suggestions for everybody
and
the reason i just put that there are like uh is uh is
the uh in initially in the initial state i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions you could say anything you want them or how silly it sounds similar to run your car at idiap you moderate chip
um turn on to see what africa by picture to um and then as we go on
all we'll have to do is except eliminate these suggestions according to um design budget feasibility so i'll be coming to you um frequently as the industrial expert judge only
how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be a or if your time is takes five years to develop this is just something you can't do
so the beginning just have a big
model of things that we
anybody can throw anything in them and just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another and then the things that seem the most attractive that
to uh to a customer
but rather than prioritize those times so that was um what i meant there
uh as i said on slide their consulting industrial engineer about that
and yeah i think it's time is really gonna be as important as money because if we're gonna sell this thing
i think the best time to sell this is christmas present
twenty five euros makes a nice little present
and we want it to be an impulse purchase we want somebody to see it and think it's gee i just gotta have that
and together well and buy it so it's gonna be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by september \'cause anything that you don't have already out there in september showing it around isn't gonna sell for christmas
um
and then i'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me you from your point of view
what
are the most friendly features that we could put on it
um
try to
prior help without prioritize in fact uh of uh of the features a lot of the work and the color and
i'll be coming back to your to help me delta suggestions from that point of david sorry coming to you for how much is it gonna cost and how long is it gonna take your
and i'll be coming to you to tell me
what can i make silly check out there well i you know what what what what's gonna really be
what they called us is all fit together still this is all
yeah
a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of here is in the thing that somebody's really just gonna take a farewell and buy for christmas for
for their child or for their husband or whatever else okay can we go to the next slide please
i i already did a little bit of research after first meeting where we threw out some ideas
and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the above the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible
so i'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying you could suggest anything like this suggestions to be really specific
so that will have a list of things we can cross off not something like you know whole house control
watching
oh
and then i found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible
at the budget that we're looking at at the price point we're lucky that we should be able to make it work the t_v see or the stereo set
um
maybe something else cube like a coffee pot or one other plans or maybe only
can i add this one i interject um something um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be
i consider it
okay uh the the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext because that's sort of outdated
okay see internet
and
according to to higher management
the it should only control the t_v
mostly because they feel that leads to clump complex the task to um to to include other things
and they are concerned with the time to market
of course okay
uh so and the and the third saying that they want to make sure
um that they have that the corporate image is being maintained and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product
so that it's easy
but that
that they can be easily identified as a product of of
of of the company and that there's no mistake but it could be somebody else was bringing this out
so i just wanted to check this here so we know pinning
too much off track here with uh with the things you want to look at these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things without only gonna be t_v
but the one thing maybe that could be uh maybe is a teletext uh idea
okay
okay
alright thanks for that
um
ah no other things that i found on on in my research is that the complaints that people have about remote controls that are out there now
so what amounted to much time to learn how to use
and
that was thirty four percent and even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room
um so those are two things that we definitely do you wanna interest
uh we wanna make it as simple as possible to make it um obvious and intuitive to use
um
then the
things about finding out
we talked about uh a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe beep
and i think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate clicking on the next slide please
okay so my personal preferences in this um project
are we really have to concentrate on the sizzle
that is the selling point the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase
uh because once there's nobody back bone cells they always say no
the back still come back
is all this is all come back and get next week you there
they never gonna come back and bite you gotta make it attractive enough so they by now now now now was a big worry
in my book for selling this thing
and in order to make it really sellable we've got to shorten the learning curve make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use
we have to have as few buttons as possible
because more buttons is more confusion so that's why i'm saying simplicity is good
finding it's important obviously can't users can't find it
so gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it
and i've already said this several times but i put it on writing here should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros
so it has to have enough value there
when somebody looks at at this uh twenty five euros um i can take that
has to be so great
that they're gonna say twenty five euros isn't much
um uh and then maybe a model like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use or marketing campaign
okay that's about it for me right now
okay
yeah and uh
who would be next uh
i guess that would be um
um
you want me to get your reaction a washer thank you
uh yeah but
three number two
yeah
okay my toughest clean
yes
yeah it's like
yes yeah
um
sure yeah um the first time
okay
uh so today i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller
okay um
go to the next slide slide this isn't it
the method is like uh in a remote control you have a chip integrated so cute which is like a pre after the remote control it takes the power from a battery see battery it can't be and and like an electric supply like you have to uh like uh the switch it can it can it can connect your uh remote controller to uh power supply from that you know electricity or something like that it should be a battery
because uh the remote control should be like you you you should take it to to read what you want and then uh uh the this integrated circuit it it takes energy from the power source and or whatever like if you press a button it's like the input for the remote control and it takes the input and
it transforms into a in front in front of bates and sends it it to the device like t_v ordered a condition or something like that so uh remote controller is specifically designed to a single device if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequencies
like uh the the remote control it sends some some
uh behaves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is the chip
figure three to recognize the
uh waves which are coming from the remote control and it should be the action like if you press a button channel or something like that
then uh the remote uh remote control will send the sender uh to sort of the signal and the t_v it should
translate that into like change
the channel or something like that change the volume control
and
uh so uh i think it's hard to design a remote control for multiple lower devices
yeah yeah that's already been a one minute yeah management so often
yeah
uh
so uh user interface controls the chip
and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user interface like oh you know switch pad or something like that but and should be there so you can control what the way you want you want to change the channel you want to control the what you do you want to go mute at new the t_v all you want to have a child lock all you want to do some operations this it should there should be some device to tell it what to do to the uh in uh
integrated so cube so that the integrated circuit can just send the signals and t_v can perform though
actions
so can you go to the next slide please
i i just don't like
to uh add some extra features to the remote controller and uh i think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the uh blown uh investment also it's like no
the text output and so which uh which are they had on the uh remote control at the
those we can make
uh uh like florescent
yeah
uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find out
remote control
if it is dark
and uh there should be a beep
as many buttons are pressed if suppose chinese being with the the remote control and uh she she or he is pressing the buttons on at the time then there should be a be saying that it did this is not uh oh well you know uh
oh action that they can be more action taking do that so
and there should be a child lock
like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh
and that what they were buttons are pressed away a child they can't be leaving you you if you if you have to keep kids and on and they'll be living with remote control or so
can long
there are two completely
yes to make it usable for more than one device so it's hard but
that it's possible yeah well that hasn't ended yet has been eliminated so that's that's it
question yeah pointing out um and uh different sheets that we can do like uh we can have you know at all adding machines or you know comfortable
but you will which can fit in d. r. hansen
um i was added a marketing point yeah i yeah function in colors also different uh it's just that one had too much to the budget to normally should i don't think it would be like you can have you know for that if you wanted just then that we basically yeah yeah and it's not just just cheap so it doesn't matter as a bunch of it looking at if you
field level they don't even better make a big difference was gonna be square or
do you think there's any chance of um having surgery having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes
yeah that is also has a slightly an idea that might make it more likely we will have to get a budget on that but i think in principle that that would be that would be kind of funny because we had something sort of sexy for adults who have something sort of silly for silly for children they can analyze jail and then tell you a little irrelevant so they can remember where it is
okay
and and uh the button buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons if there are more buttons and then it will be more complicated if you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive so i think we need to make some buttons which are which are like i'll than uh for
uh in a thing didn't it for two or three operations like if you press one button in one more then it will change the channel if you press the other button and and have them or it will change the color so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will
complicate the matter more than it is now i think i think that that's something that we have discussed only when the user interface person is i think there's a lot of argument to image for uh one button for one feature so i think one of the things people were complaining about my when i found out my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one yeah
the changing modes was so it's like yeah i mean you know all for all four of us who work with computers all the time changing modes is nothing for us for people who are a little elderly a little less thrifty and you know and
and it's a small button and and then they don't press it exactly you know something else happens and not their favorite channel comes up or something else and they are very frustrated somehow i think you will remember feel
and um yeah i mean you don't you don't feel the change so um maybe having buttons p. various shapes might be of help yeah shapes also differentials the triangle is for the volume of the squares for changing channels and so that people can um yeah uh develop a tactile sense of it but we'll get to that if you can also takes should be really clear so that they they won't be any ambiguities that's right yeah no that's a good ones
and uh display clock about it if you want more features than we can display o'clock it i i don't think it will taking money extra money because anyway we haven't included so good i think we can just definitely feedback features into the circuit here that's that's a good that's a good um because the clock on a really friendly as
when one is your favorite show coming up
indeed
i didn't know whether there is uh a lot of time is not o'clock on the screen and you go somewhere where you just wanna look at the news for a minute yeah that's that's good the corpus going
okay can you go to the next slide please
uh components are the main components may need for uh uh i don't like buttons
and that uh underneath that there should be sweets
and uh but
like i'll be can have a bug like whenever we are operating the remote control or or
uh whenever the t_v's on suppose then uh the remote controller should automatically have on super light
okay
then it will be like if you switch on your t_v to another another so was not from tool a remote remote control menu you lost your remote control it maybe you can find them in the light
um
maybe we can have that whenever the t_v's on remote control will have a light
um
and then uh infrared bonds um this is like uh when it is done yeah
um
and a battery there should be a battery for power supply
and a chip
chip which is like comparing to the remote controller which does all calculations
and vice connecting god chips which is
uh light everything's so there should be buyers
and um of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and you know different shapes or whatever the base station b. keys differ
to give a sheet of remote yeah
this
at least for that and would have in the folder yeah
hm
next slide please
uh
i have for for the site
uh
the home page of the
um
uh at that site uh from in a half hour
i got so few points
um it's it lots of fun
okay
so um we should visit the site and have a look at uh what's uh um
oh paper from uh it's not like that i have referred to be used to get knowing the answer like what what can be done working design too
oh
word models are used so it might be helpful to have a look at them
if you want
okay with you
did you go back to that slide wishing that that those set up that's it
uh it's actually then uh
did on the screen on this one
yeah okay thank you
yeah he's been doing
yeah uh you have to
no nine three
twenty four individuals for these yeah
okay
as uh user interface designer i did a little research to find out what other features which are you still would like to have on the remote
um
yeah he is goldman's
i find that
uh uh the the main purpose of our remote is to uh
control of the function of like television
at a far enough distance that remote distance
no for that uh remote control i should have a search on off back there
but the user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t_v and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t_v
there should be a signal to uh or something like that you'll be able order infrared light a delay which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume you can change it
um
yeah there should be some time with the set for viewing the politically a particular program are switching on and off of uh particular program according to the user
also i lost all their remote yes yes
if if a model view a particular program let's say and i know clown you can set the tying run the t_v will automatically research on at that particular time um
so you can use that kind of uh properties of features
and then there should be a try out system if a particular channel is not be anywhere particular uh find the time set in each then debating scan the log that particular channel so that that children cannot view them agenda
um i'm uh the uh the uh and the one of the features a user would like to have is the compactness of the got a remote
um
at the remote should be compact and it should not it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t. v. television
and uh the uh as uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of fifty and alphabet far more compact ability
um
and uh and uh and eight this one will point which i noted down like uh the material which it to which is used for what should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something sounded energy
by the children onto um independent classes and
and it should have then uh it can have an alarm clock
uh but i sent it so that if somebody wants to get up but down to be eight b. m. ninety gives at the time and it can be used as an alarm clock and i don't think it would cost too much to set an alarm clock is that a remote shell
if there is a compliment me on the whole smoking as john reset the buttons can be uh can make
we can use the throw distance
but like that the back-end is so different
uh by pittsburgh lower differently so even in there that the user can know what buttons to use the search on a particular channel
and uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that they should not being shot projections
so that if a child plays with that it worked
he he he should not
be harmed in any way
findings
uh i found out uh um and different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used that adam was which you use the infrared bit for controlling the different functionalities yet arguments which used a video use different protocols
turns
and then
so there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which i use which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of the television
yeah
many of them have field lessons
references like it can be used for the multi purpose use
not
i know and like it it can be used as a t_v controller as well as an alarm clock
to set an alarm applying and it should have a try block
and then the save electricity uh they should not be uh matched movement lots of circuits and all that
and if the person is as if it's wise the television to be switched on by ten o'clock
then it should be switched off then up at ten o'clock automatically so that nobody else fancy it and use it
okay it's like a time and time again diamonds and allow god to the television set down there as well
yes
yeah
on my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda
yeah and uh on the closing
uh basically they have the lunch break and all that
however
uh
the decision we have to take in this meeting is
cool is our target group
and
uh
what function working design
how how does it work
so these are the two things we should come up with with
so uh
the first thing is for maybe a little easier on the who is our target group
um
i guess in many ways everybody
everybody who has a t_v d_v_d television meetings yeah and i think today there probably not many people who don't have a t_v yeah they are few but in general laughed
now talking about the target group
which is
in a sense everybody but i think within the target group
we have sub groups
we have we ever earlier it was mentioned about uh um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands
so i think that's uh at one point
that's certainly important
uh um
then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything
um unless it's really very clear
and uh i don't know
how much we want to cater to chose ensues
i mean that's the question
um whether that's
important that children can really use it
one on
so these these are just some thoughts i have on it and um
i don't know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group
and for this one target will be gonna design this one thing
or whether we looking at
it will be like we've been talking about different shapes um with that different shape also includes may be different
uh buttons on them
uh for
different groups
well you know there's still motto children under six never shop along um so if you design something that's very attractive to children
um the mommy please mommy please um
you know we wanted now we want to go to the store and see that
uh um that has uh a lot of
had a lot of getting paul then had a lot of appeal but i think
uh i'm i'm talking about the functionality now on it with are we looking at different groups i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape um and with colors that's right you know like you make it nice and paint florescent banana color or whatever
initially like yesterday this example you know but the question is really who is our target group
um
do we look at one target group
and
with twenty five euros you know can we can we afford to have
uh i messed with the technical people here whether
um
is to look at
the sort of sub groups always maybe different buttons for each group
how much would that's robust
out of the cost we are supposed to
respectively spec to
yeah
gently begin begin design a remote which is mainly for the better but the for each from our pain to um forty right and and then begin add on our specific functional but then split children as well as the elderly people other people but it with
we have noticed rather maybe we can design different remotes for different people like for each to be there there will be big buttons and you know well
carnegie i mean there would be a schlesinger regimen in middle age but you're not likely different remotes
they would like to buy just one
and uh just one which can be used by all the three yeah of course that we can
do but specifically for it
make elderly people want a big buttons then you can't really make a big big remote control
so maybe specific and you can design and
the remote control living for children
what about the question marks that's not really valentine's day much and it it doesn't cost and out in that without watching much work on this doesn't
isn't it the question the question to be addressed here is a link with a target group and how well it function um
and
i think so how will it function is probably it's a question of the buttons you know yeah a within the target group or sub groups
the question is only whether our budget will allow
two
have
more than one design you need a sense yeah i mean the basic design we understand will be the same but the question is how much will that set us back you would say uh
forty percent remake large buttons and the rest we make regular bargains for example now
so that remains to be seen but
uh
target group
as a wall is
it's basically everybody with the t_v better
this can we can really is it even feasible to make
why am in one remote control with something for everyone
or we have to use the same electronics and make three different shape yeah well that's that's already in the same electronics and basically always gonna be different is the plastic case and in that case we can
problem
moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it
no no no i and i don't think and um
well maybe there's there's a nest here
and you know that's the new for example new portable phones um
they have like removal
plastic cases yeah you can have a striped what are you can have the fluorescent blue wound or whatever and maybe something like that that in each package you know you have uh there's a really you have you have for example uh what you you have let's say for a simpler one it
but then you have uh another color stripe whatever that already comes in a package
and then if people really want more colors they can bite separately
right yeah like little biphones we yet have uh different you know colors so that they can do that to identify like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the stripe or whatever they have as another one in the package
and they can go to the store for a few uh
francs or euros whatever they can buy an altar back an alternate package with another two colors in it you know for example i dunno yeah
but
uh yeah i i haven't they'll play with it because otherwise effective if we if we design adding more having all of the
uh
different
features for different people on designing three different um
remotes for three different categories of
people well i think i think the idea is to do to design one remote to you and what the only change is gonna be uh um the final project that took yeah i have to update the functional uh functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way yeah um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people
uh i have with children um
i guess that was i guess that
but still message
right
but if you have um
uh
we may have to come back to uh
oh yeah and the ones that are groups within the time but i think if we do some more research i i think disarming up the target group is basically everybody
if money permits we can address some features for some sub groups uh within that um
yeah preliminary seventy percent is a unique uh um do we can agree on on that in principle like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not tokens
okay so now i understand that's lunch break
yeah the
so that's what women do
so thank you very much yeah
and well see you after lunch
two
okay
yeah
okay
yeah
i just
oh
okay
hello everyone i know
uh huh
how uh how we're going
oh good
uh first requiring uh over there
minutes of the last
my more or less um
um
in the last meeting uh the marketing
matcher
at present k_l_t
uh
her
method of working meaning gathering your suggestions
from everyone to see how she bess could market
uh this
this product
uh
the within the budget and that was given
uh
in general
the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use
um
it's also an item that people lose a lot
so
we should address that
and of course it should
b.
something
that is very simple to use
in addition to that to make it
sell of course uh the marketing manager
which says that it's be very attractive for like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another
so that the
people are buying it now
because in particular we smaller items that's very important fact
because uh if they say well uh like a home and think about it that won't work
um
also mentioned was it should be
uh it should have a very short learning curve
and
maybe it could be sold by using a slogan
our
technical manager has
then said that she feels it should have a chip
that has infrared
bits
it has an interface controls with interface that controls the chip
therefore messages
um will be controlled in the same manner
you should be extra features like click buttons maybe i'd be okay if too many buttons are pressed
um uh uh child lock
uh um
and uh
maybe display clock
so that people could um
we could see the time you know what show they want to watch
also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes
so the components of the thing should be button box input the infrared about battery chips
wires and maybe some kind of a holder
uh for the
for the uh
i'd um
when she now weighs an hour
um
interface in there
this designer
uh um
uh has mentioned that
the
there are of course should have an on off button
and also has mentioned an interesting feature that each would have maybe channel lock
c_l_b is maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable
it should be compact her purse so
favorite was it would be t. shaped
and maybe have an our alarm clock
and the material should possibly be enough of non never achieved nature
uh
the different systems uh that exist are infrared or radio waves
uh maybe it should have uh electric electricity electricity saving
feature and
and
even possibly a timer
to so that people can program
i'm
their favorite there
uh
program on right from the remote
okay
uh
are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time okay okay
pretty much is known
okay then we
i'm looking for three presentations and uh i don't know whether the order matters much
uh i don't
i don't think so so whoever wants itself
yeah okay
i stuck in his uh
hannah and then
sorry
that's number two
three
three
yeah as an interface designer i would give more emphasis on interface held in what looks like
so that it descended then it is attractive to customers
next week
okay now this one
no effort involved is to send messages to the television
this message is could be a switch on off message i'll switch to next channel message us zapping the channel is a switching line to a particular channel like you can have the numbers whiteboard three four up to nine
nine what nine channel uh
switches
but um
nine channels which is yes you know nine numbers um
and then you have slapping uh more but then
by deducing which you can slap the channels if we don't want to see this telegenic is map it to the fort gender or vice lesser
then you should have uh next to but then the next but didn't standard that that you can keep on uh um uh scrolling the janis one by one
next slide please
then you should have a back then that should not get which can be used for increasing or decreasing the while you um
then they should be backed in which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going line and everybody should for example if you're watching the french program and you would like to have a a sub type is in english
then there should be a channel which can doing this megabits them in the television so that the user can see
and that yeah the subtitles on this can be
then they should there there should be some buttons which can control features like the color
i don't know the picture the contrast sharpness brightness
after picture
yeah they should be and then maybe some bitch
there should be a mute but then suddenly if if if uh you know he gets a telephone call
and if you want he doesn't want to switch off the
uh t_v but he he can reduce the sound again
being the why didn't down and inbox speaking now by talking enlarge the t_v
not the most important feature that i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature
it's an integrated program programmable sample sensor speaker unit
so a remote can be can be uh designed which can had the why selected denies this
you can record your own voice
um
which can be recognized by as a voice recognizer in the television for example if you want to see me if you want to see the ninth agenda if you say jesse nine gender
as it had the uh yeah the remote will automatically do a search for the night gender um so the d_v_d had some recognizer which will recognize the uses wise and according to change its functionalities none of this is one of the very important feature anymore
then draw can have
so this is one of the one of the interface
which can be created
um as a decent that interface which has all the uh uh important features
maybe inside him
then these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and color but they have may need back then is um sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that so you can you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user-friendly even a kid can use that
instead of getting gone twenty minutes late
yeah
so this is one of the interface that i didn't want which has this byte wise selected now is that um and this has multipurpose use it can be used for a t_v can be used for cable satellite it can be used for b. c. i. d. v. d.s and audio
and this has invaded voice recognizer
hm
we didn't see any
yeah
now this is an interface for to try to have fun adding looked uh uh object i can use um now this is yourself and it's very attractive and the children can use it as it is they can be a bit
and this comes with different
but as different shapes
and this this giant the interface has a minimum buttons
and all the important
uh the buttons are dead and the small compact
attractive
giant interface
so please
now this is a making it almost i assume what it's cannot be misplaced but it's impossible
exactly
no
yeah
yeah
the idea that is that
not a big again
is it better than this w. as a remote control it's impossible to get misplaced almost certain
um
those buttons that interfaces can be created
and blessed refers
um would be
s. p. uh to incorporate speech recognizers
average response to use this voice but a particular uh function
right
okay that's
yeah
okay thank you very much uh any comments on their presentation
well um looks like we still have quite a choice things out there
um well
oh
oh
no suggestions better yeah but we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more i don't think that we can get
uh
fifty shape is good the child is good
so too big to misplace i think it's just funny
right
uh the
i don't think that's gonna be are impulse purchase at the checkout counter is going to be a little bit not only all these are representation about the uh as far as the decision making we get how to combine to learn after again but if i just wanted to know whether anybody had any he any anything to add to her no i think the presentation was grouping machine really to explore all the options oh
how was the next uh
yeah um okay and you can basically do
yeah
and the next one suburbs thanks for school
components design um
uh
this time i'm i'm going to uh
concentrate more on the components meant the technical side of the remote control the design
uh
to the next one please
i had just um p_r_v uh don few uh components which we require for the remote control that construction
and the first one is case
to keep all the components like integrated circular battery it's a fight set rides like uh it can be a plastic one hard plastic
so that it can be strong even if you just uh well you know if you
if it falls down then it doesn't
three so it should be strong and uh i do not know harmful materials used in that
and it should be recycled
uh and um we were yeah and also uh using of cutting component components like uh if we want to have different colors blue red green
still uh uh we have to use a some kind of an component component components
and uh the second important thing is that uh uh integrated so cute
uh the shit we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote control or if it is not efficient then everything is going to be uh like out in the left is less efficient so if you should we should have a highly sophisticated one
and it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures suppose if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degrees outside the chip
it should be able to address is the temperature better uh
tyson
uh
i convention load of pictures
and uh it should be with uh um equipped with statement and and um facility
and the uh on the component we should of we have in the remote control is that her sister
uh
which is like out of it is very very much important for the electricity uh overflow to to to the remote controller and also a capacitor which is um
which isn't i think it's it's like a battery capacitor
and you're going to the next slide please move
uh i tell you what
a transistor
i resonator these at all this uh technical uh electra electronic components of the components which have which we have to use in a remote controller
a battery uh i would like to cite just one thing uh as we
uh if we will be able to make a three state rechargeable battery then because we need not go for um high performance battery even if it doesn't local formants battery it kind kind can be kind charge much it it it's not a hollywood respectively then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then the people can use it for a long time so in that maybe can cut at the cost effective at at and that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one
and we we have a circuit board
uh in a remote control that can go to the next slide please
and how it works how the remote controller works
when you press a button
okay
uh when you press a button when you do that
you complete a specific connection that means when you
when you press a button that will be on the small side cute
underneath the button and it will send some signals to the wires
and then the chip will sense that connection and most that fits button is pressed suppose you have pressed channel one button number one you have placed the uh the chip will know that the number one button was pressed it pros it produces some more morse code line signal specific to that button
every button every individual button has its one morse code suppose the user has pressed a button on button one then it would have is that the circuit will generate a specific morse code to put that that button
and the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the l. e. d.
which translates the signal into infrared light they get and you have got a signal by pressing the button that uh that uh morse code has been generated by the integrated so cute now that signal that most code has to be amplified by the transistor that is the use of transistor transistor be which we use in the remote control it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the e. d. and which translates the signal into an infrared infrared bits
the sensor and the t_v can see the infrared light and seeing the signal
seeing the signal free it react appropriately that when it sees the amplified of more morse code signal that it will uh it will uh will know which what what action it has to do then it will do the appropriate action
so uh this is how though
remote controller works
can you put it next to his
yeah i have few pictures when you look at the uh oh remote controller uh it's it's it this is a normal remote controller
uh and and to an extent these
and they'll be harder than the few buttons and all and and if you open the remote controller you have this secular the circuit board and few electronic components like you can see a chip then which is having eighteen bins and also up capacitor a capacitor three sisters and also resonator uh um
um yeah
and that and a diode transistor
the electronic components are all of the electronic components half or those are things like the chip and
yeah they want
transistors and
yeah the um can you you can see the d. a. w. one eight three five limited uh chip yes um
uh you can also see the logo did clicking completing things are uh these at the at the are the sisters and it just beside that you can see a transistor and the the uh cylinder shape uh that one is the capacitor
uh and also they are about
my resistance sorry
the that is that they want
um can you would want to ask
so uh this is the circuit board the green one is a circuit board
actually a building as a people board is pretty pretty easy and also it's itself to inexpensive it's it costs less than what you print on a people because they'll blow when you when you're building there are some
so cute some uh data set yields and also via it's it's better to go for printing because it you can build these kind of circuit boards on the on a book and it's just printing nothing like you know you don't need to use wires and all it's not exactly why as we are using it's just printing something on a board
that there were those planes will act act as wires and set up so it keeps
so that that green oh thing is a circuit board and also you can see uh they don has like oh um can access what buttons make it when you press a button there so cute and then the button will be activated it will it will head and get some signals from eight
and it will uh it which is to say send the signal signals to the yeah um integrated circuit
good good looks like it
uh so this is these are the circular sat and underneath the buttons
uh can you see the black car problem monks the the are the same keywords
that's good
and um
like a movie have i designed it before we have seen some uh few things like um instead of buttons we have some schools
uh let out a push-button requires a simple chip underneath that but we it has a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range maker school pros we have to go for that
sophisticated and
i'll i'll
go through a complete chip
uh and uh as energy source we offer a basic battery
uh more ingenious hide dynamo
um
a kind of provision of energy more than what is that your shape gadgety to provide energy so would that also be can have enough battery um or we can use solar cells
uh
it's interesting
yeah
uh yeah the product can be uh delivered into different cases uh usually that cases and carve flat so that we've we see usually uh uh on normal remote controller
um
okay you want and you have more pictures um we have five minutes to the any any of the other i have just one more slide open
so um
like we can have all my material such as plastic rubber wood titanium but titanium be kind to use
um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular uh um quickly at out an advanced chip on print
um also infer it includes the infrared center sender
um yeah and for the movie distance to develop a sample sensor speech
sample speaker
yeah
that's it
it's all from
thank okay thank you
any particular comments by anybody
uh on the scroll wheel push-button
um could you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button
no the the the the scrolling was different like you can go first switches like buttons or scrolls uh-huh uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before i think now
nobody uses it because you need you need about a cup
sophisticated tip and also lighting it's what do we go for uh in ordinary buttons would discover bleep buttons version look on his wrist of cost yeah
okay we don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her
okay uh i think my first my next slide
yeah okay
um ah my method that is uh i'm interested in what competition is doing
and that wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition so i've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers
i guess i could spend a lot of time on the internet um sitting around doing the same thing
and then when i'm out um in people's houses or meetings or anything like that
i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have
and if it's can be in the conversation i ask about it and i would encourage you all to the same
um
and my findings from this is that
you know small is beautiful
um people like something that really fits in their hand
simple is beautiful they don't want to have to square at small print um in what buttons cygnus functions are obvious
and they want um as few buttons as possible and they don't care for the mode thing they want each button to do something eye-catching is important it's gotta look here it's gotta look appealing cattle trying to finish fast way
um
and ah preferences as far as i'm concerned we gotta get to the market before the competition ours has to be
look really great and it has to come out before the others that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out there christmas item
and we should develop one or two features we can really do well on into ad campaign if we try to sell people it has too many great features
um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get any worse you've got a narrower selection down to
pardon
two things i think that we're gonna say are really great about our our our new product
um
i've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular in in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular
and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal there'd be more back into soft feel spongy feeling things things with maybe a little cloth on um so those are things we wanna look at as for his sale ability of the item
okay
uh
that
concludes the presentation of everyone
and what we really have is deciding this
meeting
is
uh
the concept of the remote
um
and uh
uh
so what do we think
on the concept
austin looked
you throw to come back to you as a movie any is ever likely include this feature discard this voice recognizer yeah okay
um
um
so speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned this could be one feature which could be syllable
the other copenhagen
star feature that there won't be a really good idea in my remote there but i'm already implements doubtful how how
uh find it will work
because a speech recognizer likelihood
has it
it's one now uh
this is as follows
yeah it's not distance problem it it's recognizing the person's ones like maybe different people will be having different voices so uh like it did
every well it's new you teach you have to teach i don't could recognize recognizing system that is being added in like you regarding uh about order uh um of creation or maybe
and then you are expecting an answer from for example you have a t_v systems and the use of h_m_m family members other you said i would already have a cord yeah but uh in a way she knew like
uh put money maker on a program on to see the news in the television so i would say it is good morning and the dealer switch on my to recognize my voice
yeah that's right before we get too far off here um the components of the concept is the energy
what kind of energy do we
for c.
battery i think about a battery and i think we all agree on that that that's that's gonna be most cost effective and the best thing
okay and then a chip on print too yeah well it's
okay
and the case and i think we all agree on the case we wanna have something other maybe bright colorful yeah
i'm broke colorful almost trying to do this ordinary design stronger
but um
then it is eyeing compact and strong moves
user interface concept
uh
interface type supplements
that would be your area i think right
uh
like this which is like we use buttons for user interface push-buttons push-buttons i guess uh for her yeah
uh and
not sure what i mean by supplements so when i say different types of features but then it's
you know like you but more rigorously home you should also be visible uh speech recognition right right maximum yes
but this one we put down speech recognition if possible endings more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is rights
okay yeah
our next meeting will be in thirty minutes and it in the
uh
i d.
is to is is the individual actions to be taken until then
to have the look-and-feel design
and
uh the u. i. t. is supposed to
uh come up with the user interface design
um and the marketing expert with the product evaluation um in this phase the two of you we are now in the francine have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay
it says here
oh
and you will receive specific
yeah instructions
will be sent to you by your coaches working
um if you have any questions you know you you can always uh contact me
um or uh or your coach i suppose
yeah
you're hiding
three hundred uh that is
so um i think we conclude the meeting here and we come back here and uh
uh thirty minutes yeah according to our timetable
thank you ever thank you
oops
click maxima
smack
it is
okay
okay
yes
yeah
okay
yeah
okay okay
one of the largest character
yeah i think about that
yeah
oh
oh
but
i
well hi everyone again
oh
yeah there
uh huh
like before we uh
i have read user meetings from ten minutes from the last meeting and will be okay and so
here we go
uh
it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation
from the interface uh um
designer
and that the
looks would be very important
on this new remote
and uh
is to send messages of course to the t_v
it should have nine channel buttons and next but then volume buttons sub title buttons
switch to control features color contrast truck less et cetera
different memories which you would but in your case the telephone rings or something
uh
speech recognition is one of her very forward favorite personal uh uh feature she would like see it do it do to be integrated in this um
in this new remote
um
should be child-friendly design with few buttons color for many t_vs star shaped or other shaped buttons
um
she uh
presented also an oversized remote
uh which
she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose
yeah
uh challenged on my point but
but uh
a very for personal favorite really she she would very much like to see a speech recognizer
integrated in this remote
industrial designer
um
presented her
uh
the thoughts on the issue
she would like a special case made out of plastic side is very strong
not using any harmful materials
should be recycled both
and there should be colorful
should have an integrated circuit board to that's highly sophisticated and temperature system
she would like to see a timer
and for all our might
facility
integrated
yeah uh technically this thing would also have a sister and incapacitated or
a diode transistor
resonator
and if possible a rechargeable battery
uh and of course the circuit board
and how it would works you press the button the chip
is a morse morse code related
we base the uh to the
generally
it it
generator amplification
and uh
this you could
board is very inexpensive to build
and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider
she would like uh
this whole thing should be push-buttons with the simple chip
the scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore
should be battery operated
and of course should have the special cases
marketing expert
uh
who has to find they come up
with two two to market this product
has been watching the competition
has done some research on the internet
and also
has used for personal observations to come out
with the fact that
then it's
such a remote so it should be small
easy to use
and it should be eye-catching
from our point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get the market before our competition does
to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign
could be built on
too many new features are too many points would only confuse matter
so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh
different home
um
it should have a fruit and vegetable design
and should have a soft feel she feels that's really what people want to die
and the decision that we talk last time was that uh uh
the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer
the energy should be battery
uh should be on a chip
should be trendy design compact and strong
and should have buttons
and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting
now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype
yeah yeah
because they look like that but okay
uh so this is out what uh we have to me that this is a model of the remote control in which we are going to be
uh the sense us in a sneeze shape
with
so uh it it is attractive
um and it's it's a blue yeah
hello
uh right
and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different kind of buttons
still it does up uh i look ways it does beautiful and uh and also compact in shape to uh to
and also it it will be easily fitted into the hands and and you can access all the buttons easily
i'm going to go
yeah
oops
but
yeah
used to have all the buttons
right
and uh
and the material which we are going to use for the keys is a plastic
and i know which is which is a strong
um
and also offer the
um
the material is plastic and um for the buttons that there's a lot of soft rubber
uh huh
and that's going yeah that's a separate yeah because uh you'd be touching the buttons more solid as a soft menu comes in and then um
oh for the for the land for the light emitting diode it doesn't florescent clean
and himself
uh
it is on one like uh
non-native
instrument
and the button buttons but uh will be explained in fast enough that okay
yeah
uh
we decided upon including setting features and adhere more to add these features includes and uh it's uh um signal emitting a signal it's them in a yellow immunity to um infrared there
note that we have included the switch on and off back then
complete
now we have included that the feature that is the mute button
okay
and the sight of
the market
um who didn't get included
why don't nine back terms
for controlling the program it's the different channels
yeah
we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the boarding
oh
and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program genders
not ordered uh module also contains a back then we just got is the middle but that what kind of button menu method menu menu in the main one one at the center
um
we have included a back to the just fluorescent green got that and this is the menu that didn't which will control the color sharpness brightness
them
of the screen updated that the chip
they also included a but then
we just got as this flapping back then
no this is uh a special special feature which we have included at this but then
it's and i don't get it
shaped but it and this is likely fix that
so if it gets dark though it's that late
it would take to the previous janet if it gets turned towards that like ipod paper that mixed channel
i think they are set to the previous and next gen so this is a
slapping but d.
the next channel you know anywhere
better for uh no strapping as if if for example you are you are watching the second channel that um and then you go to the dates janet and you have to go back to the second generally gets back
there's but okay it's okay
and at the end it this similar test in twice recognizer
which in which will take an extra uses voice
um and then if the act accordingly
yeah
so this is a proposed market with her now the marketing expert has to
timit
gil
a citation if they could be celebrated but but but if the request effect on her
okay well um
i wonder what i really like
a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thousand yes yes can maybe hold it in one it you need two hands and it easily reachable looking for something small yeah
yes the buttons are old raised right
but it always and if you didn't center very and you can even reach it over here right
so you don't have to turn it around and turn it upside down to hand over and ended up and down i really like that you really did a good job on that
my my designers
but
um
uh um
um i like the idea that the on off button is it really prominent place that's that's a really good
yes and it sort of sticks up so and you really
you don't have to go first go like oh yeah you're on and it's yeah the colors very attractive
um the um
these buttons uh around here are very here too
not least the front buttons is used to hearing that the mute buttons
on both sides yes yes so you can push either one yes okay so if you left handed or right handed in this phase the menu up on the screen
but this brings the million dollars yes yes the orange ones
ah
and they're they're these these two i do think either decrease the wagons
okay
and these to add to uh scroll the program chat and it's sort of okay
right so that was cool down the channel uh looks down
looks like something like itself
in the u_k um no i suppose um i have one question
uh will there be anything with non the buttons like that people know what they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what has it been have uh these patterns we'd have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons when it has some that's will have symbols that design we think either you don't really know is you know it doesn't have to first order because we need
symbols \'cause we're going into the international market we can have anything with one yes dependent but anyway would it it has to have some kind of all simple examples text or something like that i can have on the keys it's actually that's right and imprinted on the keys of tables i just wanna make sure that and manual feature is big we have a water for this mode which is and i stay shape
i shared shape for the snow right in the movies has no shown ask me he goes right back into his lungs right well you know i think we could do something really funny with this theory because the snail is going to be slow um
uh we could have some sort of little
comic affect on their marketing about how this is the rapid snail is the right yeah and that would really work
that was a one hour special features for the marketing that's really the voice recognition that's really on utilizing voice recognition those are big selling point is nobody else seems to have uh in in this price range and then and then the other thing would
basically be she's shape
or
practicality of use
yep
uh well i think that
everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical
i think we have color to we have to do well on on on the appearance
um
you really gonna have
the best third
she chooses to remote control on the block so i think we have to play with him and to play with the snail image
um play with the visual
and then the voice recognition i think those are the two things to push the lock
and the voice recognition they're gonna be or two selling points
okay now uh having said that i'm supposed to make room for
yeah sure
well now and now this was that evaluation criteria which you know him and just have done
now we learned
token bad financing
ah
and in my instructions i think it's always possible
took important um
please
what is the production evaluation is that you
yeah that's me
but that's after financing oh okay these are not easy some are you
yeah
hm
uh um
okay we had it looks and voice recognition
okay now on the financing we bring up the um
any links
okay
energy source we say that it's
battery right
that's right
okay
now
so we
i guess we use one
yeah yes
silence right
really
two
yeah
oh that's nice
the chunking could just change between them
um
he just fill in the boxes
uh how can yeah
i see
okay one
okay
yeah
uh um kinetic solar so that in the energy source that's all we need
um
uh electronic simple chip on print is that will be using one of those
oh
okay one
uh regular chip on print no
no that's all we need the one
case uncurved flat
it's single curved double curved
oh
yeah
since not single
oh
or does it still work there
double curved
one of those
case material supplements plastic
we sent right
uh wood rubber
not really because we have the soft buttons
uh but yes but
i think uh that is uh
for for that that is just for the case material so there is a special color so we having that right
hm
and then we have the interface push-buttons
yeah
scroll wheel no integrated scroll wheel
l. c. display
the wrong one
but we didn't put the clock in it after all
no
uh button supplement special color
yes
special form
yes yes you do have special
okay
and special material rubber wood yes
okay
total seven point six whatever that means
i think that's
that's the price you
um you visited
eight
eight
point two
yeah that's nice um
a pointer right
so we looks like we are
well within budget movement okay
okay
okay she said since it comes in
yeah
yeah
yes
i just tried yeah
nine document document
i mean since i i yes yes
okay
fine
okay good so that's the good news
you're gonna be popular
yeah
okay
uh um
so that uh i think financing was
pretty simple huh
now we would like
to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation
can help that
but found else you know
cache memory
and you will just the next slide away
you have the next slide yeah
okay well
obviously my method for uh
uh
to the marketing of this thing is first asked the big question will itself
uh and i think we should show this prototype
to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we haven't thought of we can't accept every suggestion of course but maybe we just need to get a few
and show the the prototype you can see research groups will not want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us
that this button is toxic um you know some charles well whether we would sell anything so we have to get some input from most people
and then after that we just have to go there best intuition
um
you know you like it you think it's good
we can get behind in selling
um next slide please
okay
yeah of the things that i was thinking and of the my wish list is really really honest in this prototype
i wanted the shape to be biomorphic i didn't want anything with angles and all square one to be comfy and brownies and we got that size a small the colors brighter and more which is what we wanted
when it feel to be as soft as possible will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped even though it's gonna be hard plastic it feels good in your hand so that size
and functionality output where stylus because people are gonna use it before they buy
yeah
so
paradoxically the other feature is in other words the look the feel um and the shape yeah that's what people are gonna get in the store it they don't have a television store that you play with it um so they'll be a main selling point so um
dot have also been filled by your prototype
and go ahead to the next slide please
okay so um
the shape
um i think
is a a one that really really excellent shape
the size is small
um
and that these points are and the importance for the for the marketing these are in how i feel
i think that it's i think that is plenty small enough to sell but i think we're sort of right the scales one to seven i think we're sort of right in the middle as far as like other competitors
and a color i think its great colors are bright and one really do a great job there
and given um the constraints that we had i think we got a soft as possible
and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality obviously we could have added
added different functions but then we just or something else so i would say that we got to have five out of seven o. on functionality so i think that basically got a great product and we can go off and running with it
uh
i just realized one thing yes in the financing there was no room for our voice recognizer
uh
yeah
and uh i don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that
well
um we had what eight eight euros twenty as a college a twenty yes the answer got that was about four euros to go see this band i mean maximum we have another four point three yeah and also i mean uh four thirty uh um
the last
i mean we have no way of presenting that to management
as you know as if
finished as a finished product and saying okay we several ways recognizer that costs so much room
so um we just have to
be aware of that i mean and i don't know whether the four thirty will read it cover that
well as we know in today's technical technological world you can do just about anything at any price of there but the problem is quality so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us
uh and um it may not be the greatest quality but may sell it anyway
yeah
as we see with so many of these come in
okay i'm sorry to interrupt but i just uh make it uh i just remember that there was no um
that that was not um included in uh that there was no room for any special features um okay
so the the error that
you wanna goes next slide marketing expert
well i i it since my last slide i don't know
okay
yeah i think that was well muscled um
um
um
um i'm supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard
um and we're supposed to talk about those things team now so if you put my last slide back up there
oh
i'm sorry
um
wow
i cannot
good
well because
i
can't remember one for long
i think my
okay yeah i'm supposed to see how long language she's here
i think you can make them different
so
now we're all supposed to say well okay
along with
okay so
uh
sorry
hi everyone
they want you there are like one being read and seven being the worst section
um well you can shake those
yeah well okay
yeah but
that's it yes i think uh shape is one yeah okay uh huh yeah she missing
okay
then how about
uh size
oh and so are you you're beautiful or or what i feel is just the average
um
oh
i think that would give it at least a two
okay
one
and even i think that that's fine
wait no
oh
for example you the designer will be innovative
yeah
yeah i thought only and then how about how we're going on color
color uh either uh i gave it a while i really like all as far as per why i nicer colors one one one
yeah one
one one okay
uh how well the thing
click here and uh um
consideration texture
and capturing the knowledge
uh i don't give it to
no matter
okay recruits your credit three
really
how many too
trel yeah
uh the rest is functionality
where i admit i was a lot harder on their king
well it's also you can't really tried out uh uh the other things you have more is a more tangible so
from that point if you but um
um people just three
okay
two
zero
uh three
um
okay
uh uh
it was slightly brighter colors or
uh how should our selling price or military
crafty
okay well
really
i don't really have any logically
yeah i know but
uh uh um
otherwise people
yeah go through this
anybody else have any other comments or any other things if you should evaluate
uh
here is what we are looking at
uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity
uh
is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy
immediately obvious include these include some more buttons and those features yeah features we can meet the buttons few buttons on the
uh i can be quite big
so i think that i mean we can we can just have small buttons and more buttons next please if we want to have
more features and i
well that kind of uh um
do the speech recognition then longer go there can be some buttons are gonna be at yeah that means the recording of uh speech liz and so that that's where we're gonna have cheery
do maybe two or whether it was a mute button instead of having to use it in uh in uh in the room
maybe we can do something with the um
the volume control you can put that all on one button
um
uh hum
and
everybody
really
oh
consolidate some of the usage and we can see we can go
now i will always be bearing in mind that right now we of course well within the budget and that we still you know
we probably can't
was this particular item we probably can't just uh
and a whole lot of more things uh huh
um we need uh
you know we need to leave space money wise only for the voice recognizer
uh
so the question really is how do we feel with the project process uh
uh um are we happy with their creativity that has
past euro or we're not happy
with the new product we created all that was created
uh i think personally i think uh i'm pretty happy i'm pretty happy with uh in it i think i could market yeah yeah and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project
uh i take it down to catch up
the problem then
uh i think teamwork i think was very very good
the regular you a you won't work together as a team h_m_m
and uh i think we
are we happy with the means we used to use
whiteboard begin use digital to digital pens i guess all these things so that we could have used the word for a cold war yeah
you know yes i mean code to uh it's maybe not in the best position in the room
uh maybe you know like sometimes it's decision so that it's much better reasonable for everybody though and i think from that point if you read so if you can audit a little bit to the user slide because it was better position yes i think so i think absolutely and project maybe all had slide presentation was made a little easier um
uh i'm giving you did we find no ideas i think we did look and remaining were very but i think we we did uh more than one respect or something and uh
so i think pleaded it's very well here
are the costs within budget yes yes uh is the project evaluated let's say yes yeah
uh version then the celebration
okay
today we have apple juice and after we sell all the newly level we have shape
yeah
so i i thank you all very much um
i think this was very good at taking and uh um
i think we did come up with a new product that uh feasible
visible from the production point if you infeasible for marketing point if you will
so okay
thank you
thank you notes
what i have learned working on
i always get on that a little
because we still have to thank god
uh you have one
yeah it's it's five minutes
oh yeah we have time left but we don't remember we were told we could and the final meeting at any moment on amazon without we yeah we didn't have to fill in
which
okay
one microphone yeah
remember
thanks
cool
there you go
yeah
