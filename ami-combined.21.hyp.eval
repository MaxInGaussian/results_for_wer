um
the one days and
yeah
huh
come all
by way
say this yeah
and uh
um like yeah it
n.
oh
go
that's oh
okay good morning everybody would like it or come back at least it is start this team
um i'm just gonna that have low power point presentation for us for kick off meeting
i names rose linger and i'll be the project manager
um our agenda setting is for the do a little opening and then um a talk little bit about the project both into acquaintance legislation which are little bit including the tool training exercise
unknown with into the project plan do a little discussion
enclose since we only have twenty but but it's
first of all our project eighty um we're creating a new remote control which we have three goals about he needs to be original trendy and user friendly
i'm hoping that we can all were together to achieve all three of those
um so we're gonna divide this up into three it
and can back clean hertz
purse the functional design which will be
um for so do individual work on into a meeting the conceptual design individual work in a meeting
and then the detailed designed individual work and a meeting
so that would each be in doing our own ideas when coming together
uh on
collaborating
okay we're gonna get to know each other little pet
so uh um what we're gonna do start out there
hm we
let's start off with the mean am
um a lima sorry only man
um we're gonna do a little tool training so we're gonna work that whiteboard by trying to which uh
introduce yourself um say one thing about yourself and then drive favorite animal and tell so that it
okay na
uh been
you know which one of these lecture between real need
probably love
alright solve this is to draw hearing what have you guys have slots alright
but uh see introduce myself lending is okay
it okay
pad
wrote
well stated made any less than doing actually some cities
file will have a happy artistic talents
heidi style your name
api up
i n. pay
beach
oh an i guess i'm the industrial designer
like i should
design see if i can get
one uh thing
in area
l. uh well
chard or
he uh
this is a this is jane has a favorite will it has
battle
i think um there
joram wish
pre relational government known
energies
yeah
then ain't
so what are your favorite characteristics e.
uh i i like all having to shelf eh
um
well this
quite co area home around where you got um
quite decorative all animals they can say who they can
they very adoptive all
they carry thing maybe with level
how um
i mean there used to draw up
i tutelage
so you just go rent table
like a low lives in um oh
uh done be user interface design
we project
i'll on
oh guess
joint room what uh
oh i should develop the evaluation virtual technology that may be nice to have a marketing and see nine
on
uh not gonna draw
or it's us
is that so this but i don't phone
some way i'll
is the world to see uh romance was gonna go to the
uh the other is real like wells is \'cause uh
though
well first local quiet objects
will so the
worker mysterious
we don't really even know much about
all over stones
the work because
on rooms
but just ago
oh uh
pull
thank q_h actions
hm
alright unjustly pattern for um
around tease the ash started off
he knew half
and doesn't a she uh
i see a sort of field and but
very or how
i
okay really how
she oh
just
h_m_m
you meeting while
i howl
uh this moment over ninety uh
i anger yeah however
spine
who who might grow
being late supposed to use the elf
he you know gavin by uh i play uh we uh
i hope they uh they light spread
i bit time
after yeah
try to paternity conducted uh in that
there are
did
uh hm
okay i'm rather so about her passion manager
i from now on one yeah
leading me
no reach
pop
c. e.
it's definitely using and the harder ones you're doing an okay
oh is actually area yeah
with a thing right
had some past because of it
that you say out
reason is there to you
h_m_m net
see you both
we could be it
uh
already to
yes
either um okay
and the red dress you can only say see how enemy in chinese
i'll time
so i really enjoy there if
listing and i really beautiful in will see
that's okay cool um okay moving on to
citing more serious and
or could talk that project finances
um we have have all it up
that we'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro now with the profit aim of
um e.
fifty million euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television that's the with market range of internment like it's an international market reach we don't have to worry about specifics
um
in order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to um be able to produced each one add a maximum of twelve
yeah fifty here at all
so we're selling it for twice
what we'd like tweaks it for
okay yeah um
just to generate all over the discussion about the project um it could i'd like to hear about your experiences using wrote remote controls
um be first ideas about um creating an in
he and no control
but would be the best
um lay you it what are the features that you really like what features that you don't like
it's utter it
send
oh i heat when there's that
for every buttons and you have to past uh actually turn on the t_v you like you have to do one for the power the t_v and then like
another one to get the actual screen and then make ask about going i know how it now they keep combining
all different
remotes together and and on all play it
necessarily like back secular trend up
did multimedia overload and just one last the t_v shouldn't um
grease gets past some sort of like
devised to help you find a hoot
and have used twelve user remote controls things like
t_v u. c. d. you play uh
meets video recorder
uh d_c_t
i guess the the pretty neat little tools that you don't have to get up and walk across a lead to change each other
so especially if you're someone really lazy like me than
a pretty nice
are on
i find them click on but a bit annoying
especially re
clark no if i'm watching t_v i have
after a three separate remote controls have informed reader one for the t_v one for the digital box
one for the video record those well
um
i'm also they tend to have
or to to be a bit confusing to took too many buttons on them
or oh oh
uh
to um to sort of
to sort of complicated s_p when
what i really wanna do is switch on and off to change the channel changer volley
yeah and um
i icsi with
having too many remotes round my dad has a whole much more at home of remotes for various things that i don't know how to work half of them
t. um
in the what's important for me i guess is that it's easy to use as
and to try
that there's not too many buttons they're not too or small you know
yeah you need to na to know what you're doing
and one thing i particular like is
if you're not um script moving it around to get it to work time infrared yeah good um i think there's a way around that
but i know it in my residents right now the
the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get into near non so it it's just simpler
just to just turn on the t_v itself an i think that's
if are gonna make a remote control richard actually work for what it's doing
the bow like batteries and things like that because there's number marks the job
dal require
it could batteries or do a remote to her batteries
um how to measure all than but we could
but possibly could use like a lithium battery uh i guess that would last a lot longer than men double a is on like that doesn't batteries are used in a lot of um maybe three player is now in the config hm
uh e.
oh it's it's a little bit of conflict over um
the uh combining all the remotes could together versus having
by differ remotes
so he'll um
like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote in yeah you don't wanna have five remotes
so how do we were met dad
got we get some thing that
just has
no doesn't have all the buttons that you need to programmed the video recorder or
program sox other things that i'm not
prequel here and about
but that just has your major buttons
fur that work for everything you know volume control he on off
channel changing
maybe that's specially divides it so it's like you look if you're trying to get the t_v on that's you know like the topping on the remote and nobody would be vertical original
in terms of how we're gonna make it but if you take all the t_v surface here than all the p. series of us here all the
whatever also programmed into it job just yet separate place and not like all the on button together to know i can only gonna wanna turning on the yeah
and it if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes
hm
that you wouldn't need to use everyday who
ma'am
okay so maybe have like one remote that isn't the main functions on off channel changing volume another wrote remote with all the special things is that is one thing that on remotes tend to have buttons that the t_v still longer have as well um so like you have to have been some workers you're gonna need a special functions occasionally
uh um
k_l_t
number selling a hundred wouldn't a normal remote
can though school we
designing a remote control for television remote mood
good low question
uh live
the first device is just to be used but the television
would read them to the could be possible to include video recorder function k_l_t
i don't know that you should just the cuda to
just the could tell every television in
television looked at boston's on
it's a could question um
n_w look into it
let me think it's just t_v mean can fit
in for taking yeah
just writes ad
new pre acting intelligent controller
it's not my grouped
leven saying
yeah
now things might be more advanced madness to
so re should
withdrew should assume it to them
it's just the television global wanted to control
we're road
i will expose it would be lost of of
play-do recording stop buttons or with the do the group as well
i don't or for works
sort of logic little
yes alias you have to define what
but we're aiming for
if it's just the television then there
it's a bit simpler concession less buttons that would even need to be on him
do
estimate the at the bands being read a barn
lark sh
move you have older people or people like me that are very court needed hand i
it's really quite important that your non pressing of small
like teeny mobiles phone sized buttons
if we can help it
okay sounds like we've got a good little discussion for our first ideas men if we will line
couldn't do we hate
um e.
now i next meeting starts in that give units
leave of actually then only working on this
this we'd for about twenty
so we can into you're discussing more new ideas if you'd like um
but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually um the industrial design ole man when you're doing um
the working design
um em
user interface designer that's rio different
technical functions i guess like keeping in mind the buttons find size applied and just
i'm user are quite good
a noun
so do we hear meta from trend is um about different things that people need
um d.
i guess kind of the same discussion that we've been having will die from the actual concern its consumers
the okay it um
and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach or realized in the past when we we didn't have much we just wanted to kill a brainstorming done uh in
so who
break side to see all your animals
and how old what wonderful um are to sailor
good and it
little
any questions
well we're gonna be discussing and looks me too
sure we never
i haven't gotten in it gently yet um i'll put that together
i'm sure as will each get our own instruction one then um because what we're gonna do is per sorry individual actions and then we'll come back together
not so it
show while have more concrete things to contribute next time
sure one p. p. c.
okay uh um
what's at the p. make minutes and probably members channel audio
oh logistically don't that
these that we talked about
i'd you email your slides as well
impulsive
yeah side please right
think i can't him
i'll just attach it to any help
in your root
your number two man two three
four or saint corrected
right
he slid his life only to you um
uh-huh before
i
it
to make sure i keep checking company by satan females
depicted green there
i just see a face oh on you can just save as and save it in my documents
or just file jan distinct pass
kind and my gag hastily
yeah and saved in anything
nice yeah
ninety five percent reasons just okay that's nesting just seem to be even less house
ed
about it
right
thank
oh
i'm is
each
okay
okay up and
i could see all again it
this is a functional design he dave
who we
just thinking i
i'm okay
clearly you
okay
no um um we put the fashion in electronics
it's start
oh gary gender today um
just to tell you the s_r_i
to new
uh um
when we do an opening talk about um did you all get the minutes i emailed them to you i'm also putting in them in the shared folder if it's
yeah that's not right general objectives and have your three presentations
um on talk about the new project requirements have just received
and then we have to make a decision on remote control functions
by only what was close
a second is meeting at back to a twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes so
press what the functional design objective this
um we need to keep in mind the user agreement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled
the textual functions designed what effect the apparatus should have
and the working design
how the apparatus actually works two full thoughts function
make two presentations i um
lingo it is you wanna you choose
oh um
should we go and or really just did it
joint please didn't
um non
either right hook
uh
yeah
ca t_v
you might have to diss the extras
oh
going
okay isn't me
complaining teams
to somehow
uh not so it's move uh
i
a classic we have
h_n_m
i i'm you have to press function
it's actually use on yeah
com's in the room
um ps think
is it applied didn't know wayne you've screwed in
count weights burden for
i think each other push it in really high
cancer
bow guy
i can okay
huh uh
making it all like
no nor
in terms thirteen million on right
they get if
i with
so uh oh and now if you lesser people to get access to um the report that it's on line or from the only one with this
name
pry out
and you know how to clean uh i've
um home
press the loan presentation it then
um political why kind of um they're above drop
it that would
thinking play
source and talk alone or up
functional requirements uh people's that's by when they rasta
um i guess real reaction did some market research they had a hundred subjects the end their usability lab
and they watched um watch t_v and recorded the frequency that they use particular buttons and the relevant that those buttons had add
it's not they found was they analyzed people's desires and needs
ocho stand their desires
um people suppose that they these that that
he thought remotes were ugly seventy five percent of the a hundred subjects
noted that and that they are more importantly they'll eighty percent thought that they would be willing to pay more
for fancy you're looking remote i don't know anything beyond what fee and fiennes but
that's particularly at used us like thing
um also
he did some questions on voice recognition and and found that the desire for voice recognition was inverse the related to each so younger people were more inclined to uh
want something with voice recognition whereas the older people than uh six sixty and above the segmenter so
did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition d_s
um people also had certain frustrations that i think that we could try take into consideration and
w_e_p
ah design that being people
um frustrated with losing their our remotes
i think over fifty percent of the people all mentioned that that was their biggest frustration and
he wore also frustrated with the difficulty it is
turn it more and how to use a remote
and i think that ties back so what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons are just needs to be easy to use
it also mention something called r. s. i. announce hoping someone might you will inform me as to what parasite yeah it's because i don't them straight and true
bunt
the buttons of store it into our
there we go well closer not like that so i guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing people do not like that um they're pad if you say yes
custer strain
um looking at the needs people
specify i_p
how on right now is that people's remote are not matching the operating behavior up people are only
using to ten per cent of the buttons
that they have offered to that line there are remote
and what people do you most often in is changing the channel and changing about young people also zap like to change the channel
about um sixty back percent
during and our have used
so we really just need a focus in on those volumes
and channel-changer is rather then things like the audio settings and screen settings and channel settings because they're used much more frequently and how all these complicate
that's going our um
so i think that some thing that he might want to think about
the idea than l. c. d. screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on
a people's preferences on that were so i don't know if that's coming to me later isn't like that but something frosty can set are also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use
make sure dad you know something like
nor audio setting
is it is give it as much importance in visibility on the remote a semantic channel changing that's used a lot more often
and basically in order for us to went over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like that it has a fancy api all and that it's not ugly
and that it feels like the waiter gonna use it set of the give them any
hand injuries aura
things like that
h_m_m
thank you very much so's i was great
um
\'s moves on to the next presentation
um on of facts
sliding
clearly
i see
yeah who is gonna do
yeah he's hitting
y_x right
huh
in me
\'s
room
and i think that's in the shared if i did a great anyone on selected
i pay people
yep
one
or
in
we yeah
right so i'm gonna talk about will be technical technical functions design the for the remote control
um
need to start by considering what our remote control actually is it's uh
a device that allows us to
did you set in affects all the television
so it it's basically a communication device we easy
which are the remote control what we want to do it sends a message to a television site
change channel will change a value
uh
yeah i just these settings adjust the by pos
um how do we actually go about designing a new you television remote control
first thing to do is to come up with a design specifications
we need to know what our final product is gonna be like so we need uh a clever idea uh off
p. exactly what this product does
uh how it works uh and what the end user is cover one from this product
um
uh away out suggest that we could care about this this by
designing uh somewhat different try to types of user interfaces for this product
um uh now in
uh trying to guess in feedback
uh about c_t_s
uh how well v.'s particular prototypes work
uh sir find out
what people think of ram
um using a remote control is is quite i subjective experience
um
but in different different people sort of prefer different things
um we should and remember but
remote controls are uh a fairly standard piece requirements when it uses using a remote control
here she expects the buttons to be in certain places so in some sense we can uh at
we're gonna have to aim for device which is fairly conventional than designing
uh so there we're not completely shocking people
but
i think we'll end up there is also have room for us to introduced novel ideas uh
buttons to make something that's that's pups a little bit different something that stands out
um also ng in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities
uh the first of these is is technological b. l. what can we do with the current state of technology as it is
the second is is economic uh we need to find a balance between features and vice as you mention things like voice recognition would would add up advice
uh but it would also any through the design of the product okay
any didn't
so i had a look on uh on the web uh to see if i could find a few read examples of existing television remote controls
n. underlines breeze we can consider uh
what what things what's good about them uh what things like it by what's bad about them it's one word room
um how we can improve on the design still there there are found um ps
what can we do to make up a duck standout phone from the large majority of remote controls
his ter examples uh
probably a bleep extreme ends of the spectrum um
on the left to grieve got uh
and engineering braced design for a remote control the so it's one that's got lots of buttons it's it's fully features
everything you might possibly want to do is there any notes got for by puts up down and channel numbers volume uh freeze frame
generates it's fully feature it and
yeah it might take a while to get to learn to use it but once you've learned there is speaking you can do whatever you want real t_v
one on the right is a lot more basic kits just got the essential functions of the t_v changing the channel place dot volume
they would be a lot quicker to learn to use it birds
i a_g_n
it's it swings amount about still a disadvantage is you can't use it
saved to it
two three rs television picture uh as a lot of features that are missing from that remote control
so we'll go to the
to find dal
fund where striking the balance between the two
um na
as i said before oh uh remote controls all subjective
different people want twelve different frames
um personally work what i want from a remote control is a device that simple it it's easy to use uh it's got bigger buttons for doing the things i do most of injecting the volume changing the channel
it it does everything that i needed to uh as i said before quite lazy other little hole contrasted room just to adjust my television
i was the one something that that looks cool um but on the c_r_l feels good for its ergonomically designed
okay think he very much
this
he he's home
spongey does
see than he'd
drastic difference would be in those two remotes
now uh
and i that were very pretty yeah um
i think that could be i've selling point
you lose a mission
yes yeah thanks to assign a market for technology that looks cool yeah yeah i guess that's why companies not happen with
my handling
pray dress
i i really can't see button to me so decision
even dare it is
i
showing yeah
alright he
in there so we did a bunch of one man or is that just product but you
so uh that was just on the hand and much less because thing
you will you know we grew older will go go go
uh or a um we
no how do i plan again
um the it's right above to wrong
there are three d. need if it's weight bottom
and there are three icons and it's the one that looks like it desk yeah them
we're looking waves
so this is our working design presentation um i had a bit of it some of the issues with this
thinkers
there wasn't able to find everything i needed but i guess that's the were still in early stages
um
so yeah this assessed though with
the think about working design is the
what we're trying to do is a working design or is figure out how the operator apparatus config fillets function
um s.
one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee go into
it works because it converts eligible energy to grinding the beams
and then you put the b. in through a filter
nat filled or so
in any get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of
electrical energy and then other things that are broad in to make it work
don't know if i'm explained that very well but has like it to us
so i'll keep the method that it's
um worst in designers to figure out what you need to make it fulfill this practical function
what what needs to be done and how do we convert all means to make that town
so
hold with the easiest thing to do is to break it down
all the points
at which you need something to have tense
it's you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted
true towards \'cause practical function
then i think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task or separately
so old
um
in each press the edges that
so the findings that i got um i've very just very briefly is that
you have a choice
of
the way that t.
information is projected to the receiver and
in my opinion the infrared is the best way to do that \'cause you don't need a site line
so that's one they are gonna work on
um the user interface is critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
that controls that converse the eligible energy into data
which then goes through the infrared so
there is the chip uh uh think ian is designing it's gonna be
cur show
and you really it all comes down to the edge of the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design
so the components that we find here are the energy source the no the battery or whatever that's gonna and make it work then the chip
which converts the data the user that's controlling the chip and and infrared d_u_c that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
t. f. four main components
and he's
they
our designs are sort of like this you'd have your energy source right there
which
guy end
file um
brings all
energy or information to the chip
which
is also controlled by the user see how note
energy going to the user clues controlling the chip will
someone i wanna strip
uh
uh oh
um the in use that thing on the you can go
pack
p. d. s. p. b. s.
sorry about they can
pardon
no want that
no one no one oh no no
okay okay let's just get back to my schematic air
doug little them
who the right with the lieutenant who yeah man
i think i_ds person
here
do much and unit
she view
there we oughta you sorry
guy as i'm kind of pathetic things like this
um
ah right
so you have your energy source your user interface used controlling the chips
the chip also uses the energy
and the chip
through the use of the user interface is gonna control switch which will work your infrared bald
which well then bring the dad out to the receiver
so hopefully that make sense for everyone in my kind of gamble delay
this is the
the parts up at the working design they need to be figured out
and
personal preferences besides the fact that i cats they'll we need a long lasting energy source people don't wanna be changing it a lot
me need a chip
that works well with the user interface that isn't chew complicated
me a straightforward interface likely and list saying simple not
over wyoming it with
information then we need a a reliable in clear infrared signal
so that you're not leaving your remote around in view having to get frustrated and go do it by hand
that's pretty much it for the working design
yeah next leaps
them just
thank them
tentative
he had he yes absolutely
oh
i'm
i'll
okay
a give a total do we two threes yeah
f. t. v. c. ready to maybe rate
yet
right manner
except
lefty lucy greatly to baby
i got back
note that we use for the road in this
have
i'm
prick about every time
it
yeah it is a good deal
uh oh
oh
okay right
the blue naming nothing on my screen
who in rio
who knew see yeah that's
okay requirements we have a couple new requirements i was just emailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in the in um in minors or craziness
we bring it up yet our at all in the meetings are far but
rocker work with teletext to be has um
we'd that's been taken everybody into as we're not gonna worry about um
not to worry about bat months topics files
um e.
it's a pretty as thing
oh you don't know in this mode no no deep into which can explain it
oh home
young slug uh
spans kind of similar to very very basic web phones now um
do you off
my enough uh numbers can you remote control
um o. d.
and you type in the page not be wants
so like you type a hundred on your remote control them this this kinda
index of pen is
on the television screen which just seems in text and some very broke it can graphics on the
when you just type numbers to go to different pages and the pitch information oh mostly rather boring stuff like what's on t_v next and
prices in my
lottery numbers and sports core as you
you struggle but if you see the t_v saying like go to page one sixty antsy fax now that's what they're talking now
huh i did so it's for your table means
he wanted to crack swings while i have no idea why we don't have uh
i can hidden
new still
okay um own well we're not going there
them and it decided we're not gonna work with that
um
okay um i were also good or like your question earlier um whether there's going to be to for television priori et cetera just for television
that over fax time
um otherwise comes to complex or one i get this out um very quickly
will the have a
for sort um at a time
um and finally at this one marketing it make um a corporate in which has to be recognizable
so while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use a color and our slogan in in it in the new design
so what's our corporate image like case this kind of yellow color which oh
whoops report functionally mailing asking we have that the emphasis on the horrors in switchboard and wall
you you'd
but it's he had we put the
um
passion be
electronic so they could keep that in that in mind here
so we want have you not looks good
yep
yep and this yellow
yeah or it had at maybe some buttons could be yellow like we can we can play around with a little bit
uh l_m
okay we need to talk well our functions and our target group
we decide who our target group it's you'll um linear analysis of different market um of the marketing um you identified that different groups one and different things or had certain preferences for example that um
yet older people didn't really care for um voice recognition may younger people dead
um
in seoul
who are we eating this that
if we're gonna say that function uh on fashion we put the fashion in electronics then neat
automatically i'd think
do younger group
that that's who's gonna be attracted do this
yeah so the think was gonna have the money to buy it
past
you you level
it's gonna be twenty five euro remember so or um
it has to be dealt marketable to a one um
whomever it as
hm
is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes in with a television because i would affect the way but we marketing
well lease right now what we're doing is um deciding on
just the remote itself
so it will probably be eco sold separately
right and looking twenty five
your abide self
the only breeds on i was given interns age was the voice activation then basically there's a big jump
after thirty five so people don't really care what has way so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five there
yeah i think that that's a good idea anomaly be given any other numbers working um in terms of each later but
if that sort of the only body that we have that
it's a violin d. age and we would wanna stick between fifty and thirty five range
that's probably a uh a population quite a little bit of disposable income for used on technology anyway so
we have might be a fairly good target group for us
now those are that's old specific for speech recognition are we only use that as one of our functions
um
um
i i would say no because it's gonna work too much not twice
especially if we uh marketing it as a setting products people are gonna be bank
uh
but drop we've got price limit of
was the twelve twelve and half euros interpretive situated easiest and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into button you twelve and a half euros without having to make too many over compromises
would also we gonna put i mean not that but i'm really gotten how about it i don't know what else you can
put in a remote to make it technologically advanced uh select other than just me yeah book guide how is it i mean it can you look really great in some of the thing up and um buttons um i don't know when gonna buy a new remote
well lit wire we
why are we aiming for technological advancement everything we're talking about is ease of use end simple and that doesn't necessarily mean hm
more technology with i think pages in mind you could
nei e.
not
if
they might be over wound the with
with a remotes that have too many buttons and you much technology
someone's looking to buy a new remote don't they want like an upgrade them um now
upgraded a well we can look for look and look at upgrade or we can locate um user-friendly
yeah simplification
yeah they could have across the remote thinking whether t_v that's just
in hertz or bunnies
or maybe a pair choir maybe yeah yeah just missing it
uh in
and we also need attack about if we're only gonna have
get a very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or and he might do it i think it's a complicated uh
which i had something to explain it like it was just a simple either that's where this way that had like the mean month and then you can pull something out kind of it might be that the rest of the buttons but there are something like when n.
did you and saying about the logo controls look good
like some to have used to have a sort of
uh sliding screen on the remote control over no it's overcomplicate buttons who so if you wanna do something complicated floor
program your television or reach units to new
you open up this little or show slow speed on those who spectral buttons and like people who don't wanna ever look at that and never even have to speak um and if you get the instruction manual icons of the and you just don't even read the non never even know that those things can pull out you know you're happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes one as the easy ones among us
not not will get once it is all still in one do
um we have to be careful that that that does in p_h_d um a chip trans any information
yeah
but at and um that's gonna be
mostly technological play you
um
okay um so i'll what are we emphasizing
light went in this city
simplicity and function since it was in a in fashion
okay those are very good goals lighting um that we had to keep in mind it with everything we do
simplicity a fashion in tsk
the or usability d_s_ps
um
how do you wanna say mac which includes on an emphasis on making the infrared very functional has made you don't have to travel around a lot
you're
looking new due there
the make the infrared more functional i why would it not be
h_m_m something i think it's a lot like to do with battery
uh-huh that's just mind a battery and that i think that the chip
takes the data and presents it while with outs for scattering
ooh
so just the call it the chat
yeah
i think self
m_m_m
equality at the quality of all the components really i mean
we can't really doom anything
shine work could this
can be visible time the line
yeah so i'd target group
we're saying fifteen the thirty five
well i dunno minute split numbers if we're not doing oops
voice recognition yeah which i kind of i kind of feel like voice recognition it is not necessary in a remote control um uh like it might be necessary for a t_v enough or the roots doesn't believe is pretty hard to
yeah hm yeah and it might be too expensive
i have the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you low weight like you needed like you would need or you just talk to you to do it
yeah homes from won't do
ultimately lazy p. from
no going people would be connected remote
yeah
yeah
maybe i mean if i get more numbers order email you before the next meeting in terms of each of those
but this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also to which is n.
i mean
really is not representative especially if that hundreds up to date then can subdivide into each group that means that very few in each each group so
yet not there
i think we're powerless word or aiming for the under sixty five or something
under sixty five have okay that's a good start
um
i'd say where it um i can we narrowed it down to maybe had um
teenagers and pam ways
\'cause that would go on to select fiftieth nationals or something
two once you like fifty by him
oh
it's it's hard to see manner down bigger out right now
i think the product the pillows cross so quite a broad range of really easy i mean will reset simplicity is is one of the features so it's going to
appealed to people oh
maybe people have problems with technology you know people will get us had by having lots of buttons not might be older people
but then we've also got fashion which is summing the definitely appeals to younger people
i mean we don't about defined as hard group by the demographic or be in we will define it by like the demographic uh
like conduct how much money they have to spend or something like that you lazy who obviously has these are bemoan the television
two and like how we seem to have a button television like that sort of thing
hm
so maybe it's more useful to just to just find objectives like fashion isn't most and even define specific
target group co
as far it's ages
because the a things all different will appeal to different people
obey
um l. there're couple functions
but do we want some book so that do we want
some kind uh of thing defined it if it's lost
um yeah like a button on the t_v and press another right or something i don't know like or beep
i mean i guess over four fifty percent oh of the fact like frustration from from have that was the biggest one and
of people's that that happened um young mentioned it before we knew about it
and if we're talking about making me e. z. that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random pinged uh
sort of a day and would be relevant like that overall calling band yes no
or put it could
okay we have to uh we about four minutes laughs to define a functions so let's do that quickly
i'm so we want something to keep it from getting lost
you give
yeah and
we'll one int
uh on
we want large buttons for the essential fittings
give
yep larger castle or buttons with the essentials
we want a possibility to on on t_i_c get
um com
possibility to get air it uh extra functions
b_m_m
yep it
which are kind of hid in the way in some way
when no he didn't but uh
but not as prominent as the make feature
you h_m_m
um yeah
he can re
and we l. soul
we want it to be fashionable
which i'm not sure if that's a functions so much is uh
uh in
yet with
slow anything on the coffee table it's now like and i saw that we've been
yeah
okay do it any other is subtle functions that we need
battery
do we don't long life battery failures
yeah buying back oh say with simplicity and ease of use really
well the names never happen treat about yeah
we should maybe investigative perfect these about
true do too
i suspects that
were control both with the book
three i would imagine that just cause it is an electronic device that um they
i think it does i don't i don't think about way can operate it chip and convert that much data with though
the one with government but you got maybe have it in a little tracking station like a mobile phone
really cool the cradle for your i'd but
yeah those list possible
get may be do that instead
so you don't thing you are like a rechargeable battery
but know that might contribute to lest people losing it to have to do that
stay is fun phase
um
page think about um space in living rooms to like
yeah \'cause them by mean which put on of the t_v or not
stick okay that's the that's a good idea it will keep it
yeah inputs herself number yeah
with biphone
okay
um
okay we're gonna conclude now it does everyone said
the functions um decay
um after the meeting we're gonna co each complete disks um questions summarize the summary
no the weight summarization
um in there we'll have a lunch break
after that we have thirty minutes of individual worry
um how much of a problem in minutes in the project documentation is included as powerpoint slides everyone can do that as well but the grape
um each have individual actions applying
he earn
rain d. industrial design if you components concept
use it interface the user interface concept
well get trend work watching
and it add s.
and is pre last time you'll get specifically crap instructions from your personal coach emailed to you
and hopefully help next so you'll be able to access more of the website that they they seem to tell you that you could
yeah goods can frustrating that
um
you sort a note any frustrations or any um
issues like half a near um
e. emu or
um
co summaries
you kate
sounds good he
great t_v you
it had been not to
they do p.
did you allow them we would look like for years and uh groups for
yes i'm just it that
hopefully it is dale to people
yep
yep
looks like there are um only
looks like there's second one kind of of mine
yeah instant that i do it's from like an earlier project i think so
argh
hum
rare is about
your arms under the shared folder hundred it might not even be new so in there we had a technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements
i least
yeah i'd only have three i just have occurred for yeah
yeah that's what i have as well and the others so
you don't huh might
no but that's that i think your ears in the email
separately gets uh of server
s_c
tsk tsk tsk yeah
na you
but defect open and then say the
pry will be there
arena and you can't sage
okay
well i'll figure that out in the med tent
okay i can ram
decay
come
yes
okay we've got actually smiled and then change
i'm gonna try it it this also
takes a while ideas
i have just ten
for consult
it's grange
if you hit a function f. eight again minutes has the same cost so
first time we hit it
does this sinking time viewed again
it helped turn it off hand here
computer
and i net there you give me is gonna be fine
if you do any again
it'll go back to just being went in computer
then other time and you get buff so if you can't
if you hit an entire as disk exactly
i s. again
do have here
yeah pick
okay needed
fourteen point he's
that leads to your home or can um
s_e conceptual design media
uh did started approximately fourteen twenty five can said we have forty minutes for this one again
i'm sir logo just after three o'clock
all um
who hang
right gender we're gonna do it opening and with it a review of the minutes of the last meeting then we'll have your three presentations
um in then we have to make a decision on the remote control concepts
by animal close
open ain't
i haven't these are a minutes from the functional design
we side our target group it is that hackers on who can afford it because we have international peel um said bits for all age groups to different um functions of that
i mean i'm objectives for simplicity end fashion
and as um in specific functions or something to keep the remote from getting lost
large buttons for the essential functions
a possibility for i extra functions like a sliding
deciding piece of
and the long rice battery or a charging station
okay now three presentations i'd like to do it in this order first do the conceptual specification of can hold its properties and materials
could be
um and the conceptual specification had user interface
and band they trend watching
alright c_f
half
whom more
function f. aid it
we getting
very
cool
home-run carey excited by
this one actually guides i uh had a lot of phone
all doing yield components design
this is where you do have cats
what does it take to make a remote control and what showed me make our specific remote control about uh
um
so we need to examine each element separately but we're designing a full thing see wanna keep it integrated as a whole
the main elements of remote controls in general and therefore are as as well i the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip
and the battery
these are all things that we had sort of address the for breath
you know take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made as them what they should look like
the case uh the options that i've gone from headquarters about what we can do um there's there's a shape
ah the case we could do a flash a flat case the curved case or maybe even a double double curved case
i haven't seen any pitchers of what this exactly looks like yeah just keep that in mind that these are the options that we have for manufacturing
and we can make our case i out of
plastic them and the main base would be plastic but we have all these sort of fashion
in technological elements we can hand in the word latex titanium rubber or other color just types of plastic
that would be our case
but um buttons for buttons we have um
push buttons which is what
real reaction uses the most often but we also have a scroll scroll wheels which can have integrated push buttons for we could go all high-tech in happen l. l. c. d. screen
um circuit board in chip the could have the simple one a regular one or an advanced one depending on what are other needs are
and then the boundary i think is where things get most exciting we're talking about long life batteries here it only hit we can have your sort of basic double a batteries but we also have these options of um
using the kinetic battery or like are used in high tech watches when you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up
i'm so simple movements like pushing buttons or would recharge the battery
or solar battery of although there are slight
um
complications with solar battery says in we can't use a latex keys
if we have bay solar battery
or um something they only described as the type a battery you find in the
toward she's from about fifty years ago flashlights
not quite sure what that is but that's the description that i receive still that's what i'd passing on to you
joe those are our options
um
from personal preferences or i was thinking
through
here's what
we've been talking about all through fashion them simplicity
so if we're going for fashion in our cases i think that well we're gonna wanna look at is
a curved or is double curved case
probably with the bright idea of design elements maybe titanium maybe some word we're gonna have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual materials
that's sort of what i have in mind and we wanna go for simplicity
probably push-buttons but i'm stream intrigued by the idea of a scroll
scroll wheel if any one has anything
any ideas on that i mean i know the uh ipods and things right now have touch scroll
um
buttons which are exactly like what they're describing so that might be something wanna look into or
and i'm really intrigued by the idea of that kinetic battery or
at the solar i don't think would be such a good idea because how often
are you sure that your remote control will get on the certain amount of light
but this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and a simple just shaking and around only get work
i think that down would be um very interesting thing
s. but
i think we'd also want to go for a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down um we really only need a regular or advanced chip if we're gonna start using in l. c. d.
so i think we want
to be aware are not making things bold really
technological if they don't need to because that'll keep far manufacturing price way down
that's what i have for options um i appreciate anyone's important but that's what i'm seen for the feature of the
for look of this thing
it's double curved like would that be like to hear d_m_ts kind of thing
i'm not sure a haven't received any specific
visual c_n imagine mike
double curved does like
you know like two so the
kurtz is not i'm sort of herve just be like
a single verb polished come with yeah and now i'm not sure but i'll let you know as soon as i get any pictures
hm hm
yeah woulda
i know if we do have a double curved case it can't how any titanium in in
but the titanium they were quite their marketing quite hard to less as being used in the space program
so that could be quite interesting space age when mode
he hearing
it's just all things say just aren marketing window yeah element
that's bet i'll have to do ads
i hope i didn't go if is that too quickly
i'm just a broker question um
the weight of these f_n elements
and you know in idea or no idea
um
d_c i'm assuming
is that ps
a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much way you and that at to titanium is very like i know who um but that is uses that's really basic
it's me
that's all i have gotten so far t.
modeled
any other questions
i think see yeah
we can save this in the uh shared projects if anyone wants to look geeky thing that has considerable notes on the topic as well if anyone needs any more information
oh
um if you meet got yourself you can put those on her um
interim either
just oh look i knew both in a way but if anyone has a specific questions don't hesitate to email me or something
right
because like
you know where around consent p_s concepts of user interface
i hm
hasn't called since so much time in the thing
me
you know
there yeah
three how
l_c_ds
okay
cool pages
both p_l_p
uh so i'm gonna there's gonna fee
conception varies user interface listed device
how long we've talked about how it's uh
the two essential properties of a user interface we wanted to be simple
um it's free wanted to be fashionable
um in
uh ever
we've also got to remember ever this is the device itself is useful purpose uh remote people to be able to use it as a remote control
so we need to determine what the essential functions up but
of the device uh at make sure v_a_d
re includes
the river included all affairs that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people
we have a number of different choices for a design const right
uh on and start stopped something that there are actually some examples off
um
but
it's functionally we need to choose
how how is this device going to work how howell
what kind of model for this are going to be fee user interaction with this device
oh once we've chairs in uh uh concept for its we can um
designed a features of on the concepts making sure that we get
will be essential functions in the device and l_ms
uh the extra function he's uh the more advanced features
and of course we also have to make it looked co
so basically there that's what we're going what
we don't want slots are buttons are complicated features we want something that looks nice and simple
here's a and a fairly simple device this is a comply point from apple um
i think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four button this it's very minimalist tickets design
uh he uses for button s_t_m
to move amounts of range of settings on the small l. c. d. screen
um
the figure i like about this is at
it's very of a quick
to access the main features i you can just about make up
uh if it it's the bottom three buttons are uh
uh previous track next track can play poles
but i the main
the main features of your i bought the things you will use all over time
um
but if you want to do anything more advanced to go into below when you you only l. c. d. screen and use the buttons just to scroll around and find more advanced which is what
so i think that's not too good
i could kind of model over we could have
um
his uh a number example this is uh
it's an interesting idea and ps i think it it looks pretty cool
um it's certainly got and the multi value
uh is my some colorful it's nice in bytes
uh uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around the button there are different shapes and then you can sort of
yeah if you watch interior the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons which
and basic can yeah it's if it's fun
so i uh i like i like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often
so you'd needs
the few buttons to select a favorite channels i mean most people when they watch t. b.
for have two hundred fifty channels on the t_v and then watch of
for for over the west
so you'd you don't buttons for your favorite channel changing the volume which is something you do over time when you're watching t_v
and the button to switched off because you get bored
um the other features things like adjusting the byte misschien in the t_v
uh
i don't know how else you do river t_v
um
but do is there
these are all necessary function is uh or you can't have it
there's no point having a television but you can't she'll go but you can't see the contrast
so we need to find a way of including these somehow out
um the uh in one of the suggestions of make is to him
is to include them in the menu system a bit like only ipod
so who would even have a small l. c. d.s display on the device itself
or um uh have a just a menu display the comes up on your television set can be controlled through the device under what allied to access access the advanced features
uh at blast keeping a very small and simple set of buttons
for all the features that use most option
okay so you'd be avid getting your mail c. d. then
a thing goes
that's one way to go yes
uh i mean uh the the advantages and disadvantages if you did
if you have an l. c. d. disk yeah years it's nice because it's
it lets you just sit down and stared control your television from your armchair in here
dot disadvantages and m. l. c. d. display would have to be quite skinny \'cause with it
rain wave
just as
what would i seem we're gonna be make quite a device
uh
it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting is it because interrogations watch t_v in the dark yeah you need to be able to see you out the t. l. c. d. display
the alternative is for half uh
and all screen display on your television speed control phenomena control
a bit like a bit like a they have these some digital boxes where you you press buttons and he comes up with the on
this thing of watchable wants on each channel i mean not that's also a good idea
it it account it does have its problems as well if you've got a small t_v and you're sitting on the other side we started with the teletext comes out
m_m_m
uh but that's uh that's of this i'm
decision there we can mike
i do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seen and then you can see what's on them
um
in cell
like favorite channels is is applicable but i think he but you do need to have some kind of function work
it's
um you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description of it i don't like i i know i use the experts outperform like you were saying well if it if it was a lot else die on the on the remote i don't know that you could from yeah you'd be able to see it i think we're talking menu
like
contrast and covet tuning maybe see or something if i understood you
yeah the rather double in your hands when source yes
okay
but it is an easy specific some experiment minus than if we put the display on the remote control
good uh i communication is one way sorry
you can't have a television send information back to work and to look at least i don't really need com
me
hm
uh locate
yellow language work it
oh could take
cat
pump up
okay how mica
um d_c oh well
function no mark
oh yeah
it will go
i'm
what i've
period cross five eight
just in passing multi tap
oh i don't know how
well then i'll have this can beep
anything this oh
thinking
um low-slung don't do
oh yay yay
could no
no
okay think that's how we're gonna look a little bit trend watching
is the uh it's getting in my um an executive summary that was
uh mark investigation and remote controls that was recently cannot do it
and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan who viewed comments on some things that are gonna be going on this year
so first um they have people pay rained on the important aspects of the uh remote controls
and right now i like it they're saying that currently there is a functional look and feel
preference but that believe over the next year uh it's that's gonna be switching to uh
fancy look and feel a remote so that just goes back to uh
the whole desire uh for our real reaction company wanting to fill this on fashion and
so even though we're stressing more shockingly mug and talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea uh
they're sort of my has to remember that the number one thing forever and is that it's fancy look-and-feel in as these are brains
the top one is a double-a important to the second line which is doubly important to the third one so
just to take that wheaton to account
the second thing that was mentioned as important was that technological innovations that would be like if we use something like this these material uh
l. c. d. screen things like that and then easy to use was the third most important would so
really matter what we need to fill this the most something anti-lock appeal according to the us
i'm not sure gary i
nor hand
option march
talks about that this year's type try infer close issues are pretty cheap
eight it is it's in
oh it yeah
and that that there's a preference very sabine t_v
tight materiel oh
and so about things i assume i've heard so if a bit is
who once this punch your remote for or what you are not sure about
i
they that i i
one thing that's gonna ground this
i out work goes stale this use the phone
um in the year areas so
even know this is coming from as a as you know trend watch market research
i don't know how much of review death there really
wanna take away also considering that the research but has been carried out by real reaction i'm a little
has a chen as to uh
like
how all these questions may have been worded it and if necessarily this whole fashion into technology you do the easy to use is necessarily the right drinking
personally like iron might reverse it but
if we're working because company i guess no matter what we have to stress fashion the most
is necessarily needs me a spongy material oh
yeah that it there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that window
yeah i've
have a lot of notes to share if you want than that pretty much some of the of
three of
he do we really
see questions for the as
yeah um uh when can i
parts that we can link them
um it do you have any ideas had a it
possibly you est these
um header how to use of fruit vegetable around
or the spongy material it all
who inc
could we make is like could we make a spongy remote it'll be easier entertaining asks
if it's latex e. it's kind of
i'm in it going to have to find a way to protect like the chip and alarmed
it it in in
i my understanding of ugly text cases that it's in fact hard to project
step inside but it's not covered with billy text which is spongy and soft or on your hands
it's there's something to be said i mean med we got that
three or earlier frame you about um not wanting it to
ah power repetitive stress injury to um beings in in
yeah yeah so something instead of it'll be yeah great and then you want grace no more then likely easy sinking into this yet entertaining and envisioning more like yeah
you know the material that you have when you said monica bicycle delay doesn't hurt
yeah you say have one hundred i'm imagining that sort of thing and another but uh my things down
given the list or materials uh this forward it it's that seems doable
could we go when fruit and vegetable colors you could color currently visual or or maybe like
um
couple name ones being like on the lennon's are striving
it's just
the the buttons could be feeding mouse way
who is he supposed to be shift work approach
more
i don't like it or carrots or something
works great period shays fig link here and there
converting the buttons could be shake large button does less again yeah
oh but if you look around remote mc either by convertible up and down on like problems but those right
could kinds of
she at that through
yeah
it
later i know but i think you'll be able to hold it cause i think the reason they boundaries are uh
but it button do
thing
be heard at the time this is when you when you use a remote
you press the buttons with your time you check
yeah we'll functions you room
i usually hold it when he and maybe
or maybe you want something that shade like a mobile vibe
so you you hold it in once you possible if the buttons actually very sign tended to
yeah just and just um settings on
but i mean in order to get to all of them you know yeah there have to be within that a certain amount of use only don't mode
four five buttons anyway permits install this motion
it when i'm when i'm pressing buttons when where i'd like that so i do it hold it in
s. this re audit in one hand yeah and you press
you press the buttons yeah and where you menus
or my thought remote wonder figure on the touch rather
right below the article yellow uh
um we on like i found
he slid the bond on an ipod does it what is it is it just four buttons or is it implied
well there is one of them at all um well here
it with him each one version of it has been a little bit different
the one i have doesn't have
the for a new like uh yeah you have one or the in between lines when they were doing the anymore
when you press the center button that's that you won't be so much smoke and right
um okay this one is going to ads now night
yeah
i think might be good for us is \'cause like you could have the same we'll sort of fact fur
ike
channel flipping and then the other light could be like for volume like just the idea of like filled
so few buttons for main things but then hynek go back many oh
and like
i don't know if we would one and on the screen the error
and the actual t_v i kinda em wanting to say on the t_v \'cause
for changing the brightness lunch when i see it happening how do you
and
and if it's all has a veil screen might be
good to in huh
theory but not as useful we do this is to um practices
yeah well served yeah \'cause you would be looking down and we'll see this man my copy t_v and then people don't wanna do that
okay um
we have way about fifty minutes left so i'm i'm gonna end
continue with manfred presentation um and one more slide before we close but in that site is when we need to make decisions buttons these kinds of things so i'll just bring out
it it
show you'll
well we will read
how am
with any more information aren't fruits and vegetables
have lunch
to me have
changeable covers like free or mobile
in different room vegetable fillers yellow
he e.
you can spot yeah and then they take the covers could be spongy latex
whereas and but the actual model could be taking you put it you could
caught the with here
half so problem affected oh
for example resident
the the packer during
it should be like a lemon i'm the the packaging is like the peel
so instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it remote control
i'm very low bit the bullet like that i can do this
i mean like was so over cap
flown
thank you wearing it all comes out
num
oh version it's
okay did um components concept
energy fo
ship oh me oh yes
right i had sort of skipped ever that hoping it wouldn't get
be necessary abut
um this is that this is the age and they gave me so he just sits low-level back
decisions elect the
okay de sit
this isn't like directory on
unless based on the battery you do um
or two people to
of this
kinetic battery i guess i think is a dos that maybe it's really cool
yeah act
yeah i mean
and v_a_t
totally take care bar problem of not wanting to change that is
yeah
no i think is good too is as long as we consider the the cost to uh
how mid-level it's
programs are really gotten ennis group
cost yeah any more information on cost other than it's more expensive that a regular battery
in but
um
f_t over time but if we're using uh any
that cheaper chip in a you leave it out i think
oh i'm circuit boards
is um yeah i do bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced there there are thin fiber glass with copper wires latched onto them
and good i think they're quite easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print is when the machine prince on the wires and solder it all together for us
i don't really know what's tell you as far as decisions i wasn't really given any options i was just given that this is how their done
okay
um
yeah i can't can really tell you i can i can tell you a whole lot about how it works
but i don't know he need decisions on
if there if there really options off
and sorry yeah looking for circuit boards and putting options and
s. thirdly
understand it
um okay there've cool move on to the case
um oh but i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple a regular and advanced chip well okay here's the here's the thing on the chip set uh
that i got um
simple regular advanced chip-on-print to the chip on print includes an infrared sensor so we don't have to worry about that
um
k. the push-button
if we're gonna have push-buttons but they require a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip n. and l. c. d. requires advanced
do we wanna scroll mail or do we just want push-buttons
um yeah
i don't think we need really need us com
with real i mean it might be nice for changing the volume
it'll be nice for changing the volume but i don't know how useful would be for changing the channel because you don't have control over number is are you are you really bond issue even triangle
it be handy for going so throughout
if there was an on them menu appear channel choices
when you give scroll you could scroll through the channels
and then the volume that just light minutes left for the meeting s_n_r volume or just be like the same way
yeah foreign backward bells
i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleep error
sort of a look gain
yeah
and otherwise no matter how many buttons we have are gonna have like you know black with red sitting out on the note it's gonna never really sort of start looking like
you know it's gonna sound like we ones having uh stack tab
hm hm
so
have a scroll for volume
or for all us equiv functions
when you get on the on screen menu of all your functions light your remote
could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheels or go through those menus
i think you know i think the scroll wheel would be nice but it's not necessary
right him
so we can either go with a simple a regular chip depending now maybe we could table others um pre later
um oh
i think we're well i think when we're going to be the user face we're gonna have to decide the interface we have to decide it um
whether i have a scroll or not well let's think about that well we talk web pages against a case i i'm kinda like in the idea of latex
if if spongy is that in theme
i'm a little um i'm will has to into that it because i'm worried about protecting stuff on the inside
ah right
um what could be horrible and then attacker everything that i would be more okay with like it titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone without kind of than what i've seen
just not related to this you got of latex cases before is that
there's lot like a hard plastic
inside it just cover it with a latex okay not too thick layer matrix just enough to be curved double
like in by candles or or anything that you've seen my at
that inside is hard
i don't think we need to wary about
pre tagging the circuit board i think that that's time for us okay
so we are it be do want latex
yeah
do great
techs uh ooh
in probably in colors may be freely vegetable colors
yeah add
we d. galleries
okay um let's go to the of user interface then what them back to the
chip bases
oh and we wanna curved to case yeah
or a double curved \'s
well we don't really with the differences right in thinking curved that's non story yeah
yeah you're okay
we don't i know with a difference
um
you k. interface the type and the supplements
so
oh pushable or scroll
right
you know tho
um in
and i think if we wanna keep a coast um we should just go to for push-buttons
because then we can half uh a simple chip
uh int
it's simply it's it's cheaper to make push-buttons and there is a school doesn't get us in terms of e.
did terms of
economics it's probably battered
and if we had a c_c in on screen um
kind of thing that you could scroll through like you can use the buttons to scroll very clear years
you know arise
i think fit is fairly simple
for a channel surfing i think the scroll an actual like on ipods kind of scroll thing would be to fast
yeah
i s_p
push-buttons at least in most we get any information that i have no idea how much more expensive the scroll wheel is then
and cash button but it's gotta be some more expensive so
no i think it might be better to it
put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery in the k_l keys to
you know
there's there's gives you do you feel yeah and let's like see big anything else i mean i'm not
records all of the scroll wheel it's more just to give it a different kind of look but is it gonna be a way tax
pick thing and that's gonna local walton
but spike them bigger impact on school room
yeah
okay so we're gonna go away if a um
type
push-buttons
yep
and then supplements howl we gonna do that
oh what you mean by ice opponents
um
i assume that's what else we're gonna like half the um levy additional buttons we can use
home so we and have like a menu button
you'd so that we can access on to being things
you know
then okay um so we're doing an on screen menu so they don't score or buttons gonna be hard off
on off uh volume
five or channels
oh so like when you're for wherever you go
you may your tape stars that are you lower your little remote you results
um
we said gender roles
and stay we're gonna need um numbers
went use the arrow
oh we wouldn't even yet on numbers
i think maybe numbers seems this kinda hold any energy he said it
check out i guess you can just hold it down
yep when you know you can just to new scrolling i need some kind of
i dunno sort of up down kind of button yeah the volume control double from out
for example
h_m_m yeah
okay now i'm intentionally meeting now um the i'd actually exactly thirty minutes um you need to have things to do look-and-feel design and user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modeling clay
no get
so is this which i mean
you basically run it on do we said on a chip let's go with a simple just able to yeah
yeah are there and it'll take you everywhere
oh i didn't these are the and our shared folder okay cool
c_r_c
for a kit
wasn't expecting looked like
i looked for
paul wanted
can
place
okay
it pretty
t. one
whom
okay
have kick
okay um
welcome to from large detailed design need eh
in pretty ski
k. started
i
park silly fifteen forty or something
finish
no okay
to uh the agenda it we're gonna do lip opening and then
yeah i'm a whole
time five minutes from last meeting what we did just fast
um
the we'll have the prototype presentation an in depth look at the evaluation criteria aren't
well look at the finance there's
and finely do production evaluation in the close
so starting else with um last
classed when i down here
um but we talked about energy were then use a kinetic battery
um we want to use a simple chip because we're not gonna need is a shuffle um
you can e. the scroll
um would choose in allay text case
wing fruity colors it's curved
and
uh um reusing push-buttons
and with this up modes of an on screen menu
so it sounded like we at set to um
like eva nine buttons
including five pre set chips
okay
let's do though look-and-feel design presentation first
but but it
do wanna slipped
right well wave three different prototypes and i guess we'll start with with this one uh um
the have our colors not
are not fixed that this is the general shave
um pits you
sort of
yeah data like
this you can't already such a lower and net
\'s easily adaptable to either hand
you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push some with your
index finger for other hands or even i mean there's a whole variety can all the like this impressive with your same index finger
uh we have the on-off button at the chip it's very visible sorry bake
we have a pa
up and down buttons which are also gonna be are channel selectors an we have a little menu button here
if you push
if we're just pushing is not really there the menu buttons if the the volume buttons rather if you press select once they become channel changing buttons
if a breast s_l_t three times in the menu with the other features
and prod possibly also with here
t_v channel traces shows up and you have here five pre sets down here
i'll have people one
have holders that see how it feels in your head
bats are number one proto type
um
you when there
preserve the potato or shall we go margin using the little labels and it will take a bit
you go about one long bus uh
the
no long box parameters on this one is known as the potato
uh i_ds
we should uh huh
how can i presents it
it's oh no ergonomic shape
so if fits in yeah and nicely um
\'s designs to be used even in your left hand or or in your right hand
um i i've gone he just uh just for four buttons on this one
um n.
two glue buttons here uh i for adjusting if only second volume up
uh i volume down on the other side yeah
um there might one is half for it
oh changing xu
channels
channel up and channel down on knots um names between
your favorite channels did you've selected
uh obvious middle button yeah things up the on screen menu
and money work in in the on screen menu
use the of a full buttons to navigate to how many system
and the middle boston uh to slacked
uh mints
that's basically it us to tighter
um of on off
uh but would be one of your channels basically so light channels ever would be
just issues haitian machine off your
could the metal button on the on screen menu function of the power by um
um mode
pots
um don't really need it would make it hertz to turn the machine off
the done your t_v off
if you press and hell that may be
look at the other download we want to do you agree on on off
so you possibility uh into
and then he finally e. we have
um thingy martian or the parent
either way um it's a bit a different
just
oh what a bit more my creative field
i have the on off
talk e_s_l stemma
on a top
oh
we have the five pre set i
seeps p_c
very
yeah they have all the sides to make it a little bit more three dimensional you have your channel changing volume chaining buttons and a menu button right here in the middle
some
glad for your consideration as well as plus system interesting talking wait to have standing up we figured it could stand up like this on your table if you wanted to if i read about the bottom flak
so i think that one of the battling right uh the menu select button
it's very interesting this this is a favorite sort on software prototypes oh
basically you you'd in terms of making decisions what would need to do is
first of all decide on the form uh which should have three different shapes to remotes then
decide what kind of button layout we want how many buttons and then to choose what comes we want to make the bottom this and if we want to put any text on the device like labels on the buttons or
word band labeling
whole
and i go when or whatever
we were we were thinking that
normally we go with fir fruity colors but maybe
we're also thinking about you short of
middle aged
man
for an example customer might not want of pretty color and remote sown
maybe
we'd have one version that's a bit tone down
okay maybe with a with blast contrast on it
my something's still a little bright to make it hard to lose but
but we don't want it to look black could story
yeah so that was one thing that we brought up over email i don't know if you picked up your email that um the the on feature that we considered for it not getting lost right well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email
and
me think that each of these are so distinctive
that it it's not just like another piece of technology around her house it's gonna be somewhere that it it can be seen do so we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be
a script on channel composite panic charging since then
small
would it be a very difficult to on just have an extra low device that like i don't you
tape or to your
to your t_v it on that when you press it you had a little like b. goes off
give that would be
conceptually possible
i think it would be difficult technologically you can because if you only few remotes lost
it's probably on the vice t.
and in that case you can't be shown send an intranet sync signal to that
you will you lose so it's
i'm not quite sure that's true yeah we wanna we handed i wonder if it's
if it's more just a can make them and he feels
uh warming up
how many times do you millie
seriously lose your remote control when would
would a device like that actually help you to find
there might be something that you can do when this circuit board in the chip
to make it make a noise or something but it would take a lot more development that may have this half turned
okay
that's and pair evaluation
did room
um read so we don't we decided not to worry about that for now
yeah \'cause more designs are very bright say you're right they're gonna stick out
uh you you said do people have a preference is far spiel and functionality
yeah like s.'s
simple parrots are sort of already possess so for trying to think of something
sort of like new went fine given that this is like
well your initial i'm initially trying to do just that it's like come from all and i cannot different
i sort of like s. one like i don't know why it just it's like small but still all
sort of like q. looking at how now
but i also like the the side buttons on how only like i think that's kind of kinky
but
and a how much idea \'cause has to do with it
the fashion i'm bob
sword of cool looking
thing that we also need to focus on to
could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on of both
so then we will will uh familiar um that's good
the
yeah air
sticker
that's if the selected
um and why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria motives money like i think we're supposed to have wine that we do it for oh okay
okay i was so small they examples to do compact the me i have to like writes on the whiteboard south
yeah that's or just right on the right now i actually don't have like uh
halfway back and so make cuts
thank you would be reduction
uh
since head like a joystick anything
but that's not cool wouldn't they
maybe a little smaller than than the right now like it but customers
basically any for two years
no it doesn't kind of placing the better the phone
fruits with
she heard
ugh i think you for for uh
yeah it could happen standpoint back as they do kind of like the standard watch
yeah
i don't sell to give keep a grip tail
\'cause it goes in between anger in him
just think like this one
okay it's everybody deal only then this detail
i like the idea of the demons to i mean that's really gotten the simplicity other buttons down
that one you who'd
i am weighing about like on using the menu
um
in uh knit
like him but did menus their submenus in so how do you get back to the main menu
well at on the ipod for example you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again it brings you back one level
but that has a menu button separate from the select button whereas if this one's the both the menu and the select button
this is a disk in the up and down buttons are used for scrolling option down for a list of choice
t. escape
if are in the choice that you want so you press that uh you pressed the right button
uh
could these you used for going to answer the just we're going into multimedia software is maybe it could be one of those if you press down and hold
for two seconds then it means you back one model or something who
okay well as long as we have that in mind as we're designing its channel
yep
okay so which one we sort of roughly linear hats with drafts
whether an attack it
needs a rs
um in this as the it's
but yellow we once thought
but it up are willing to is that the tens though
okay well we cannot doesn't change it actively go through all this amounts of basically what we video
he's and then things are we talked about
with four wings make sure that remote actually guys
conform to the things that is that it's going to have so always were wanna do is we each need to separately
range each of the final thing that how tabulated average just to make sure
she doesn't need that closely
did pass time
will store round
jen topology are still one sat in with
one me really sewing show
and that in me in
not through it all or fall off
if their remote fairly create it
can bore us of buying criteria so we can do this one first
first i wanna know i_i's uh the end the look-and-feel all
um jack debt
so i can i can he end up
for apple he's
yellow eyes poly somewhere else i'm with a life
then rate
that's just phi
yeah
oh with that
you should hear all
i i kind of think it's it to you could have that i'd give it a one or show
no matter what give a dollar to there
i will give innit
a one
um crafted it's creative i don't know if fancy is there were uh you use
i don't know of any of them or and see
in in
at say he
too because aren't yay
now go for to
spare
what's on
alright a seems or scale for functionality is it functional
i think it's true one john give no one
wong
i think he this
it's functional is also pretty basic so there were there too
heiga
um
functional
i think it'll get everything done i think he might be a little confusing you
versed
um
well there's no that's that's gonna be a later one that okay then i may give it a tip
en song
i mean what i don't say this technologically indicator
did you view a functional
after she's that
um this the technologically innovative yet
whoo
mao really i mean
that so much as we you don't ya think he's reading you don't have
yet each ed
other than on it looks like i don't know if it is
well the kinetic battery the battery
e_s internet battery that ones i'll
how they you will notice
but it but don't is definitely a neural appeal okay i have never change the batteries may have like latex family together as we walk obviously material
visit my clippings allow teachers other made it really
yeah
uh island say that
it it's yeah
yeah
like fancy versus creative it's it's
different
the design put in a bit of a now
i'll give it a three
time
well while
i'd so it's technologically is not
it's not a unique i win this is just
is it is or just push buttons um
so appeared are for
taking went go there for as well
h_m_m current
to really make that
did battery there
next is it easy to use just say you know easy till one am will be separate you can't
go-there
overlap them
i think it's blaze uses
all give it
put chip
oh
okay nor one
pretty hard to matt so
let's said one
how it's say two
more a
um being a song as the if it had the spongy holiday
and david you did feel latex rubber right is spongy okay
keep a wind uh
i wonder if it bouts is when you drop it yeah
who then maybe her break character you it \'cause there'll be less impact we knew where you don't alter one
all rate and the next is does it integrate some gaussian of fruits and that it is
oh for about uh uh well if they can be yeah uh oh
it might be \'cause that's our corporate colors lit
that's right i yeah a corporate color we didn't keep that in
phenomena bit yellow
well if we e. eight
i don't make it a little less could a little more confusing but if we had all the buttons and black and we're designing the and the outside and yellow that'll be our corporate one and then we could also have all true of colors one or more conservative one
one is more fruit till you kind of way or something
i yeah uh
you have this um and can we have like an r. r. inscribed on the bottom or some fisher
hand do
right so he gave it really slider got that skill
so it's i think it's it's kind of a newly to oh i i look around and see over here that's that most rich yeah oh uh but there and number
why na
i'd to
one gary um and if the design it match that appropriately remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of items that they use the channel copying the volume boast
i think we really have that hot sony per one
yeah in retail it
done what
you saying wonders
yeah ace
okay on also we talked earlier about ah i fly in winds for rat
um
i verify
a whole finally i
have they inc
we think that the later act sort of greta
the p_r_m releasing that into account
i think i'll be good stereo because he must feel it and away you go
just gonna need had to do
and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing but on
i mean how might the best and like outfits in the handle
spent
and i co at the tail
uh i'll say two as well because older people that are used to like texting but if i might band okay
new
pop at first
yellow i'll set to
right
hm huh
the easel wearing at
i know you were saying here a little bit error stuff uh
and now it sort of reminds me of the a guy and i just got my ass or read the instruction book inundate okay you out
and i'm not good it learn to
now hygiene
so i'll give it material
the menu system and uh the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing but i think it that's one one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out by you'll have it afterwards
so i i think i'd give it it to i guess
i think a to
it's probably a little out of the mess with mixed from um because you have to
you have to use them any system and you have to
tell you what your favorite channels are mel could take a better remote object first um but
once you've year once you've learned how to use it
point is um opens and so on group of
one is at the
i think it give it a four two it's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy once you've done it by it
room
all rape um
also earlier read something about losing ends an hour nap address and that at all
so
wait we i think we can kind of see we dressed it with color
a bag so in terms of having it do you think that i yell
but as a seven
our easier martyrs that
so latent
um and i'm gonna give a simple or exiting the
we can still image memory again the a year kind of background by about many more often it's gonna stand now
um might tear it give it uh three
is it depends powell
tidy weren't on you
q. give it for
oh could work for cause
it would be easy to lose in this small to
i gaussians so the simplicity
how how all of those it
i guess just be each
ball
sports a user simple and design
yeah name overall \'cause we had said there were two meetings or simplicity batch and so there was an exhibition
at it
separate from b. n. c.
like
actor okay
um
yeah like once we example but it's not like total easily sample so i'm and give it
i'm well give it a three i guess
we'll give her to
very
sorry again bash and well
\'s totally that you'll
i don't think that there are going to be very hard i will have any bigger i think it is very technology and fashions
though really i i don't know i don't think it's quite a special balls by robot or both
may do it like uh
people religion whatever you like others allow search
the fruit good little bit
it's number uh there
to
fruity
co one
and does it need ah like
demographic and the saw uh for international heal
that whole day him
so the ritz server ions
um see when at
your mood
i think as long if we offer it in aren't
in a lease three different color arrangements
oh yeah yeah as good
so i'll give it uh at till
he and
should you
right so i don't have any other features that they think are important that we didn't thought welch
well oh um we didn't
we didn't address the fact that it it does need to have a corporate lovell solids
let's make sure we keep that in mind that we had that one of our colors concept is for bread and has nah on it while i think all of those notion are yeah
and so were it
okay so a lot as a
a hooking
can round
well nothing lee
okay now we're gonna look of finance it is um i have an excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost
um
oh good
we danced servers
hm hm
okay um uh a yeah i know
re and a
who we're space
it is in the in real work
and on you
okay
canned dynamo
we using connect batteries right in that it yeah
um i'm having one per
when isn't okay
um electronics
saying yell
simple like them somehow uh
okay
um the face
pop uh
do us just double curved
is different yeah it's very clear e. so okay
yeah definitely get a pinch of it so i don't know enough
ah case material supplements
yep sweets
was of any plastic and
no wait we either plastic is the plastic for the inside is a scene bad at the side of it is
the what i guess it was rubber otherwise rubber an special tiring
yeah
you the good more than one special color
yeah we're using we'll just through special pretty the release two special colors
um i don't know with all set the basic color is another yeah
well but we know there were having on these three higher so you're saying what are we talking about on each
color combination are weak
no we'll like we'll have yellow and black
is that
two special colors
yeah i don't know or that andreas waned like the engine's water or
uh
i guess is three just seem to be three three you were
in flying
maybe are are are we in color as well so you know interface we do the push-buttons yeah but how many buttons do we have
stacks
five had
i'm not fast six with the power
and see
anything else
no oh we'll or do we will
well buttons in special color squishy
to get that which oh way oh buttons out so um
so the case in jail would just have one color
right
lingo everybody is will be in special colors or making multiple varieties of
this is rhyme getting confused
we're saying co per unit
yeah i'm here okay so each unit will only have one color alright in each new button but the cases
could have up to the true i mean the buttons could each could be up to three colors as that's how it's designed there i like i like that um
okay
um special forum
they're all kind of just push button no i think them defined special material you want the rubber as well probably yeah so
oh did a few do per button do i
no i don't thing so
i think they're if they're all gonna be rubber it then it that's what it matters
yeah so like func anyways cause for the whole my case material totaling one yeah it's minutes to make a rubber okay oh wait maybe
there are teen point seven
oh i'll
yeah apt
what can we were gonna exist have our buttons all be one color
um a cat like the button and is
it's or whatever is harder to two point three anyway uh
okay i uh i we service double curved maybe it's single after no idea we've got
i don't know mining it any measures
it is yeah it's better to see through
it yeah that that calls not yet
okay it's kinetic battery that's kind of expands amp
but we have a simple chat room single curve
case material it is rubber it and that's special color
yeah
but that's important's
yeah this is six or buttons
how do we know six allows easy just teens
well says they must thirteen and now it's fifteen
they'll okay maybe not
i don't know which is happened
from e.
now n_s_a twelve
uh i was out target price again
top drawer ipac okay oh so much used
so we're okay na
growing thinking
yeah \'cause wall
he ish
okay guys we're all sat
um say e. you
i save that to our um
ah
big shared folders so you none
um the o. k.
the back till agenda
oh
um i the air the costs under twelve fifty euro yeah yeah yeah they are for the last the project evaluation
project processed
so as action with for example the room for creativity leadership
t_v work their needs
in your new ideas happened
so i guess what we're gonna talk quite here it is it just evaluating
how we create it's project information we guide um in use how we used to it
if we're able to uh on
you know nd user creativity with the information
um how all hell well i guess i and that it's
um
the uh hello when works together as a team
um
the digital pens the weight boarded
beep
okay
i'm tell very creative
paid do it
read in the prototypes
i think we've been successful in but re
the two you've
almost all of the design goals that we set ourselves per slot
and we've come up with a finish project and and we just about got separated cost
i think we could have done even better with a little bit more information ling what's a single curved case how many colors
what to colors count
hm things but given given what we had i think we did we did really well
um
i think we worked together for him oh
you
yeah i never ever play that more
market research in hundreds industrial thing that had taken them to output the first a vegetable stimulated by creativity anyway mailing to them the whole thing going to your screen
yeah i'm i'm even
i do think though wouldn't the pen little distracting for me personally
like a tapping their us um
or just being so can't just served
turning the p_h_d or the town
knows but have a distraction
yeah
back button
i chose not to do a powerpoint \'cause they and it made sense to us i like that i had the option to do that and just stick my own notes within that sort of thing
yeah i think we all made um very sadistic contributions i don't think anybody dominated it
which i thought was really get like each of us
was able to um to give you hide your information i
um i tried of sil data with that
like taking a nova um you
yeah you kinda little finish models
if there really keen the current one one does it get we work at this this book bag over uh
show you have that's somewhere on the packaging
i have little trying to think of a good plan that they could add there are are
i think there are limited it like one single
ooh yeah there are are are gonna be a c_d in yes but
hopefully that words are swayed figured out
fun pointed but
um
clooney useful little gadget
of things the in the design end up has a huh
okay it um what to bring new ideas thousand
people should really base their boats literature vegetables that not lie there
or or at least be could put creative enough as big of
tucker switches see you
i i'd set and
i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now however joe it anyway them
yeah was even know they exist to any it can get watches that happen like really quite expensive watches
that is an ever need a battery \'cause you're always looking here at z. two
but in other things adding give you really good
end it yeah
a toss
uh leave
okay closing c_d
that the cost than the budget
is the project evaluated
knows final questionnaire and meeting summary
um
so to see great products kids i think we've
create it's um the really interesting and then we have a market for it
um on and
specially if we can produce the at twelve point three which we help
um
yeah
make sure in your questioner put down
coulda systems of
well the process on non um
the air final results and
yeah real yeah if you like the mercenary mode which is more than one that would be my second job have w. i. second-rate out of the top toggle i'm afraid something would turn bring it reveals apparently didn't bring it it it certainly has like what has happened is
as this did home and then
ah it
go there it's funny
he'd
i visit it started has up
care but that it started looking were were like a bunch of whether he didn't think when using them right now in in between them
i
at it stands uh on
um new
well hell
we actually bracketed sever remote control comparing them
so ah oh oh oh oh off uh um
he'll play the um
it
do bleep
congratulation is
do you um
easy just see
nothing will come up and software believes posterior is ready and
yeah
um you know many if
yeah
it doesn't matter classes anybody this thing like taken matters class personally by me but if that's the company or word yeah but check it out so like all these like blanks that are gone
you know that all you need to keep in mind german knowledge management it good
there is one which a unit on top
when first released at make it really to do the job rosec products standard uh it's okay
oh it's very work relevant gets the death as they were out
no entities definitely
and they said that i didn't get you link see the corporate website
oh oh here you could see with delayed able to recover website
it just just inspiration about circuit boards the how
it's really sleep one
it's that world there
get it so to low
that would like something is pretty cool yeah so that excel it's one like the program six inspiration um
basically many p. two cents or non caching blue
by coming thing thing
um it's not even sue yeah my inspiration from from last time this is in the in the interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit talking about circuit boards
i learned a lot actually number i could probably take apart a remote control now if i really lose here
that's summer school are we able table and everything
now have will no
circuits and chipped soon
trends ponders or work i wrote it down because i thought it would be relevant play all the different parts of the inside of a remote control but then
fair like you know actually if this
you think might have had like it would you prefer outside his group or multifunction remote control that i didn't have like any kind of table
one seven from but they ask the questions or to for their school
it's relations signal
i thought it was a little check e. having to hand around this
that it you could
and yeah do you dot of um
otherwise the technology out today as kinda cool
the palace really how i get
your limbs and
we didn't use the whiteboard them org
no
although i don't see hello
elie colored have
very a lot leased from me yeah
ike
it is her if i'd gotten pitchers of the different parts of the case
the different looks of the case i would have probably trying to know
it you
simmered moody anything i think usually like whiteboards are good
no across the idea earns or like
if we had like a bring they were gonna gonna brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it but then that we are going to with only four people it doesn't running
make sense to give and without any with the powerpoint that we can all look at like you can do all those things pretty much on powerpoint
give
does anyone ease myself not
made us more mines like take note spend uh
like made appear \'cause all needed them separately kind of and the whiteboard in this room
because we're all gonna be work doing
in different places
yeah
big
if we're all gonna stay here all the time then having the notes up on the white board
but it then alright but everyone needs their own like specific note i guess
now when you were um creed in your or
um projects here did you work together or did you have like do separate projects
over in reported to go over
yeah i'm but we may click
lot
whistle-blower different showed some room
discuss tower of uh
how the buttons work work
you view alone
and rs
how we could block improve on
with the swords
does it it better both really every just kind of started out by taking a color of clay and
just fooling around me that i came out with that run the shape in him and then sort of potato re
mangos we shape
and then c-one from their real
cool
\'cause pun
it
displays anything manage spent i thought well managed
o. t.
i reviewed right
the first group people go with since decent
this reference data actually
we'll we did a good job of multi
for of decisions again zip
back scoring they are there because they haven't got the time live
and i what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have ratings and then
people so jeff the wave about anything actually you really been decided
we both in here we don't
pre do clearing and decisive
decisive points down would be at the meeting said that we
we knew words are gonna want
pierre i was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting
we didn't really have enough them information or make firm decisions about we're able to do it regardless so
i'm are usually very decisive person set up to have people finish
there's these isn't able to
keypad than
i found that we did it we could have used another five or ten minutes
you especially lasts turn you yeah
yeah i think the last um we had a lot of information
it it to see man
not quite in a half
you know it in mean
we'd and we couldn't answer every single question
um
by it
and right i felt the first two meetings but i was coming in when no information and that sort of
me me you really early
i don't know the ring together powerpoint or have no no address again last time it was like the opposite
add so much information in so much talk about
is interesting what came out like later like as i was doing then it
when as dinner break down on the agenda that they gave me um that more points came out from your presentation even
um
i'm a little enamel spleen that we didn't do uh um
something for lose in the remote
yeah that was kind of of eight point ever that or something like
in order to talk about that we wouldn't for had to have actual knowledge about
circuit board so that yeah it was leading as you normally just for creating on the
c_b excel file there wasn't like
that option to select it to
so no not included so there was no what we could do like yeah i really didn't do there's no way restaurant
continue down that i was really there i think we were just getting over enthusiastic through the task
didn't want interestingly guy into it i mean i got into it
as they went on i got really working who were displayed a remote control
professors midi button knows about
it was interesting though that they cut that fifty percent of people say they have research with liz in the remote and if they didn't provide us with information to
yet button
yeah room room
we should to be
discuss that
i deals that like people
people have flee
things they can put on the keys they precedent they'll be yeah but i but i'm sure that would require some kind of technology that
person or what it at icsi there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things
see won't lose them new
i don't know the mean we were talking about it in lake
and and my household at least there's only about two places but the remote is ever who'd because there's only one t_v and
there's only like entering chair just he's any always two in the morning
did lose them in your pocket like use will forget that
or or like put it down from are there like me exams and then
no remember there's a reads with so there's things
yeah
did it depends on how organized you are personally yeah are like current guess what the set up of the houses to you
brought a new
ah i am not sure areas for losing my key scratching my guess up several of them
cut when it
he's the refrigerator the other infighting number
so it's pretty clear issues away if
it's m_m
but it book
uh the new you take yourself to the bag it fitting whether this rated
co back to my room
cake it in kick it is what color i like it should
definitely in the vegetable sure yeah little bits
a book we see that the via my code and i using a different code
yeah ng
yeah up
but i guess that's good we don't really care grounds or not much yeah
can only take into theme and
you mean you with very little robot but we could happen have uh
robot alien pair or whatever he's have a little voice line
i name them dated
it in
error
i cheapie s. and uh
click it if into the deep yeah
hm hm
h_m_m game
although if it's sitting still for machine made when the block by itself can be able to get a model that you were released and crazy like a lecture magnet that you push it all with you individually it's and it didn't look but is it just amelia
just fit view it it
like you'd have to ever book for your remote
let it get bit in you
if you want but if you could attach them to the t_v in yeah
that we got
one
m_m
oh men's a_m_s those
est
syn just um
true now statement minutes
he decided to what you have center the email saying that powerpoint minutes will be complementary rather than like
repeating a mips gonna make
making ball minutes so that it will include all of the agenda animal i d.
it seems a little quick s_s_h
she felt not the most typing organizing to do
but it in have like information to
\'s laugh
yeah any to use them
how much of the of powerpoint was already done for you
every meeting knots did it
h_m_m add ins lions um
they added a couple slides each time that spot
hand in the deweighting slides \'cause
i would just get slides were titles on them a new build the model number
didn't even think about adding want
well the thing was it would provide an agenda was like several points but it wouldn't bother sign for each point
uh and that's the only way i remember that i did all of that point
that i know personally when i do powerpoint that's on a deal
and so i had of ones that even if it was just like the title of it like this representations when we do you actually
it yet till the slogan on it okay just be like
the slogan on in no detonate none
with like they can go around me this is uh no i don't think we need to energies already aren't especially if the yellow line
blacked one
is he elham below
or yell in blue when we go to the web pages
yeah i was just kind of going by the web page because they didn't give me any com
who leah
like yellow n_r_a's the lower
growing
to bring better than black doesn't so probability which
ca time
it leaves timit i'm like news clipping it's
finish meeting you know who moved
was in it it just seem that um i thought was interesting that are marked marketing
um tax bird did not agree with the marketing um
i know it enjoys it is yeah exactly
well just got is you really want to actually uh
of really big market evaluation you when just have
int one set of
the source kind of and they work so now i've backed up would just be accented you make we did this survey if that's what people off then
unison
um can i don't know
employers do that
depends it it
sort of it grey isn't
yelling great that than the slogans in blue
well we got some grey and we had some little buttons we're going
yet all
well the obvious operates like flames
mediate like
tied of
we can always be
poll we're not
sadly printer actually produce a myself oh old if they work amount
with the three her but it but it about a corpus into words i'm gonna play big intellectual property it yeah uh
we
particularly the whole that it's done um until it's been that long
gets like didn't
it
um thank you can't
christian easy
oh
wells
consists
for a sec us
hi case uh would morning oh very clear
um yeah i want to introduce myself uh many me is uh sri the prosody in uh i'm the project manager for this new project which we ought to do is to snow
so i want to introduce first off all uh the names
the call e_q_s here
and what you are the two main
uh i share my name and segments and i am uh
he user usability user interface designer
i don't is it an idea accounting
uh how you spell your main uh e. d.
p. d. canes
do you also do a marketing
so only he contain
i can't oh yes
i eat
and i'm christine h_m_m and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer
the shifted sign
and that my everyone
so who's uh marketing no pre marketing is uh is me
you'll have a
so uh asks thanks for coming for the meeting first of art
and uh
we have a un
long time just put firmer nets to discuss about uh this project and uh the project initiation
first of all i want to house the distributor about you or a marketing plan and dealer product line
and eh you
well i think you'll see that throughout the day and how we're going to put this the other as a marketing to
to mark had
product
we'll have to see
five through discussion on where we're gonna go for
this
h_m_m h_m_m
i'm but to be already have like oh functional design or uh technical design uh for the moment idea
but for the moment not hit okay but to what's what's your are gonna do you have some project plan
some tea
raw
and could crashed
no this like i said we have to be discussed between all of us um will go for
a factory
um it's a program to walk out the other
okay s. so
oh by when you think and you could in uh
gimme some kind of uh project mime
okay discussion need certainly by the next meeting
my next meeting okay the to the great
uh
okay so does any questions or uh a store for
yeah board uh
the \'s project
where's the coup project
uh the goal of the project at it maybe i will uh handout to the you'd
it's a blind
the prodi
but he's in the sale sign or colon in the sailor so there flaming what to do
we are the define exactly what our product this from uh
yeah it's uh can you explain uh what exactly the burke series
full one i had a mine
we're supposed you marketing coffee
he's ever heat
uh i think uh i'm not thrown we're making the remote control remote controls \'cause i had two different things i have the first part of mine was to make a remote control for neuf remote control for television
i'd after i had a discussion about coffee so
we'll start with the remote control for television in there
three of the design something that is very user friendly
h_m_m in some thing uh
visually has something that we will draw people to buy the product yeah
because i think everybody's experienced with the remote controls some remote controls are hardcore if uh throwing out the window
uh ne
most are on the but i don't know we have to come up with a new idea
part how to make it
a lot easier reuse
h_m_m hm
slot times or
spend
half a day you through them
instruction book trying to figure out how to use it
yeah hm
and uh oh
what two but christina what about your uh the industrial design line
paul do
have had design already on this
product or or the
you still working on the designer
uh um
no i i have not began working on the design in
and to a um
i e. a
i actually didn't know we were designing a remote control act can't we were designing a new monitor um
the him
website i went to look add
had some announcements about and then introduction of a have
uh some sort of us seven inch hound monitor
and um
i e.
understood that that was the project goal
so um i'm but i didn't do do any work um had a time because
at clear they didn't understand the project goal
i k.
um
i just
i did see that we're starting a new project together and that was before member team and compress of these people
and int um
at spat ten
that's a knife any read through the different steps and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps
so it or you will be leading the team for your design team or how many members is looking in the t.
people dislike either for the industrial design yes
um but why would they think that depends on how much money give x.
from from those mostly because uh you know he can they can make it uh
yeah different choices have different financial models yeah but the before we talk about that of finance okay
uh do you have some idea a hope we can uh sell this product or project in the market
and how much is willing to the benefit to the company and uh of course it still individual also
well you know one um i kind of think they'd in general and you have to do uh
uh um yeah you have dozens free fashionable
then it's a very attractive that to em
people see and recognize set its goal with and uh they immediately wanna have it uh
have one of the round so it would valley would need to um
something like the ipod would be good seems jeff caught on fairly well and so
um
you know okay would it do i was just so it looks cool
f. eight
but uh at of when you think you can give me like uh
kind of for decide on the functional design all the technical decide
well uh i've got a lot of the projects i'm doing right now
um in so i'll have to wait and see how those uh um how those go if they are go quickly it and then it could be a month with um
by run into any problems and my other projects in might be six months
yet but uh i need something in the writing so like uh what's your functional design what so technical design
nine uh how many people you need for this project and what's the time frame you're looking at name the what the budget may be uh initial particular working
okay i and uh always going to the market okay so you you had to me to be the marketing team another way to market and whether the marketing strategy line
okay when are you going to introduce okay and by the time introduced a product a and they are not uh that would be a competition okay it so i need some kind of uh
well co
dub
clad in the of item from your
okay
and it is well july thing
yeah s. and as possible
i have well on
uh if uh even
if we have enough time uh
then then d. seem ten um
two weeks is a uh days close enough
yes i think that would be good because i need to go to the management tender tell them what we are going to do and uh what's cost stressful okay and what's the time frame when what's a project plan
because uh without any other documentation side cannot put it on management and say soccer we'll want to do this and we need this much money okay so they can
it's it's difficult for me to say will fit the cities and i need the some kind of plan from you initially okay then we can how the for the discussion again
uh
or or there are other people who will be contributing to the plan
yes of course if you did some helper also let me know so the people you need the from the marketing or uh the technical side or at the administration point of your page three adding in a documentation or some technical point obviously just like my nose like an important at all the intel can get plenty on this thank you
and uh added uh oh so what's what you'd think about uh
this sir project
for the remote control and the t. how some already month something for you marketing strategy or uh the same strategy
we will now yeah other than uh from doing research and taking remote controls are looking what other companies have to do uh what are building
there are design is there ideas is uh
all septa pinpoint which market we're gonna go into
yeah hm
my should be a fairly large market because uh
the number of people that uh uh
competition
hm
uh debris has to be something it's has to be something
s. we something that that draws people say hey i'd like
x.
whether worse and added a of the first say i like is that like the design
and this can be simply dues
yes
so what i uh for for maybe uh at your between try uh more with the kristi okay because
you'll know what she's going to the way
okay and you know how do serve it
oh see
there goes
uh she's doing the design but you're the core because you're the marketing okay it's a bit you need to sell any your that responsible for the all the money to finance okay two more
so what i for for okay so you need to interact with a christian more and have it in her team okay with splitting the functional design and our technical design looking and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan okay how you're going to do those
your cells but
okay do real audio what cost
no limit on this than idea of how much uh we want to mark this for edges of the cell for a heads up
that's up to us to decide here so that you all to decide okay so the best thing is you well bottle of uh the kristin and you will discuss with your sil locate and come up with the cost and how we are going to
compete in the market what k. and uh
technically or in the sales wise look at the commercial wise
okay it's then no we out to design okay how long it will take the whole project okay
how much he's going to cost us and how much will going to but but for the company
okay
of course it's it's uh fo of
been fit for everybody in direction
oh key
so i think it's uh maybe if he can uh he needs some kind of your uh the sales black okay
including the technical what they she's going to talk to you within the t. locate then it will help me to discuss with the management for father looking and put it in the the proper project plan
it and if you need it
any coordination in between uh come back to the maybe uh some technical wearing the solar commercial vendors okay difference if you want to have some off a marketing plan or technical plan okay so let me uh
okay i carry water name
far may be
uh
your mike or net done with a
um with clean uh
allow no not exactly mean my job from what i understand where is
so like at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use apple like of the best ways to do that
yeah
so i think i'll have to interact with christina see gas at her yeah
should i she's not designing something back
my study as well show her right off the bat that it's not going to our and so it's sort of it's only that feeds and but
i don't think necessarily fact
i mean this isn't
in accord made him
position yeah so basically you need to interact with could a student more okay for the user acceptability
yeah here and the dusting courtney then which will also feed into the marketing yes depending on what users want depends on how you sileye it might tag lines you attach to hair
how you do you adapt
make it more attractive g. user so i think
all three groups so one need to interact quite a bet
an un
i guess build the plan based on our that exists and you need to take all the factors into account
what eric was to locate the keep it in the low yeah easy you are uh meeting in christian meeting because he should know what's happening yeah we can see see ends on many discussions of most and reasonable based on the males look at all the discussions to me okay so i need to submit to the manager
yep on
so at any questions for her or time being
so the immediate next that fails to start determining the functional design you this in the
still come over the functional design and uh to discuss with and locate how it went to work and the first of all with the work
user acceptance yeah okay hold it looks like an nodes went to work in the market
okay
so then we can discuss about uh for their things okay so
in my point there
will distant
four do make
ps okay
thanks for coming which mind a um
at the conclusion if our meeting could do could you send us a copy of your slides
yes ma'am i've in movies yes
i copy uh let let us keep all the emails and all the copy so cliched uh each other look and so you know everybody what's happening
checked
okay
and if anything you need any time so please i do you can call be or or just sent me email or uh
just come and uh not might draw okay so on my mission
each could okay
okay thank yep
as with coming gain the additional standard
can see
silicon
a over
one session on my
uh as testing containers
free uh see why
state are point this year
um i did as no no so yeah
i ran it does appear and his uh
i he's
thing image occurs this there you go i don't need to this for sure
okay uh
could this
we can then info shire funny
h_t k. really come back
i hope for you how uh fresh area there in the first time
housed now the uh meeting actually we
yeah that inc here
to discuss a board uh functional design
may t.
okay and uh releases some information from uh on off you and it's in uh i think uh
the shading falter and uh i will invite uh that this gene ending eight and uh agnes to discuss it work on the various subjects
so can go to the next left
uh the age or not the meeting ease of opening
then uh
i'm going to talk about uh look project management what i'm going to do and uh of course i'm doing the project management in secure keyboard
taking can take the minutes of the meeting
and that all three presentations one_x uh new project well mine's
and the segment no wanted decision on remote control functions
and uh funny via closing uh and the meeting time will be all forty minutes
so you how to be very click
and i'll come up with the management gone with the new proposal locator and go to discuss the group one of those
oh board seis
newell in slides
in the aim or your project
but the one lee's uh
the teletext becomes the or l_p models
okay because if uh because of the computer system signed uh new technology
so
we don't need to constantly lay about the teletext and all in all the new project design
the second one is ps about uh
the remote control
should be you'll est only for the t_v
that's what our uh management say this
i'm not toward wired it so vibrating for dame
two est operation our uh marketing or the corporate image
okay with this new project all newer product
so i really had wired uh
agnes can you go to the uh colors yeah
then this is the third fight
okay these
so
i leaned my to just gene to discuss about uh the functional design
\'kay july now
check when
um where
sees
uh
um re too
nets it
john to map sir john miller
a done nice
piles
so i'll wire um
oh why yeah i figured uh
who we should
um my identify some user requirements and from my experience i wanna uh uh end from
the research i did e.
uh the
the device s. trend television on and off the first time you press on the big button he can't tear
um can have like a war falling on this point two million that he needs to be able even if to be able to find it
\'cause one biggs problems with
remote control suisse
finding them up
so all um i also since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product
though that a look at things that are popular and um picks go beyond though as soon as i said and first meeting
um yeah and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction special in the the yeah the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance and is reliable and so forth
i did a little history on now and the the uh uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth so it
i guess this guides lean if uh created the flash dramatic
check out like the idea because it made me think of phone uh um maybe their remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the t_v on and off that might be interesting
and um e. so it was a highly directional flashlight
then i could turn the picture on and off and the sound on and off and change channel tsk so i think um those are still requirements we have today uh
fifty years later
and uh we're was really a pioneering innovation but it was uh sensitive to the sun so that day would get would start off by the you get
can with
easily cause \'s um problems
so well higher
i eh in addition to uh looking at the uh um
uh the functional grouse all these devices are examples of where uh l_c_d they can represent
examples that are available today d_c
check things but one in the middle

and it is something to keep in mind a be easy to find
hand to harm
it would uh e. eat
he could for it things if the t_v didn't turn iron a few could
user for something else
and sin sun not really um
oh industrial designer i didn't i know what to do with this high
i'm but had to um
i he just took some
different uh the schematics and i put them into this and i guess this is what aside might look like if you were dying a circuit board cannot at i don't know why i am
rasta do this
soap
uh
personal preference he this
ma'am
i think we could d_e_a up really thinking outside the box here i think that we should consider perhaps
having in it and at though size up
a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference so something is very very flexible on inflatable and then you can shrink it
think
um do you could either be you could go either one extreme be very colorful or you could make it clear and um kind of
blend in with things so you don't have to um uh have a problem with that the the decoration of the if the user's home
um i think good it needs to be waterproof because uh sometimes if online to cups and you know might be a by the swimming pool or something like that
um
if you buy a matter what what what are my requirements was about it needs to to tell you when it's done its job or not because after timeout keep pushing on the remote control and i don't know if it's actually
understood my message so thank it should give you some sort of an oral cue
and no course i never wanna replaced the battery
so that's those are mine if preferences and that's my presentation
yeah let me uh in top-tier uh if he can add other for similar to other creature light uh unbreakable
yes or period before those uh
especially today you know you have a family and the katz okay and the kids draw tended the play but there remained outside the car yes okay so if he can add the future okay before you or or fabric whatever you the overall plan design okay with unbreakable locating that will give
a lot of i'd went page
far or product
gonna go is wrong
good idea how how the how do you can uh added in that
he's okay
okay there huh tainted justin and uh uh any questions or uh classifications or
any discuss channel on the functional design
do you have any pre conceived ideas and terms of materials
because for example in the m. breakable thing doing something plastic with b.
harder where it is
having something like
i'm have steel or titanium isn't really economically
i'm
yeah possible will be hand they too yeah
no i haven't really uh evan
i wanted feedback i think we need a great rain keys yeah but we'll see what you're a choice no preferences are and now i'm just wondering whether
the you had any
i like titanium it's a light
for yeah
jets of
yeah a marketing comes
it will for a you know nobody told me how much what our financial objective is so mine
yep
if you already inflate something it may do you do it uh oh
this is the last meeting with supposed discuss about the financial thank
uh let m_b_t quickly maybe if he can go back
and so look of project plan and the budget
rules
too less
see
seem
memories
no it's kristen's size
it's team
and that's mime
uh i think that only have it i will send you locate the project maybe the the project eight one k.
or the end of the date the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million room
okay
and uh of course applies will be ready reasonable on uh the sales side okay that to maybe you give a talk to you bought the how much of the price and towards the
how much of scores for the manufacturing and on what it's going to be resale in the market
then uh you can combine it with your feed back and uh i have one maybe the us additional being in this remote control okay
it can before like even we were should be used for any t_v
okay
and we've would this silly
we create and uh
pat
not fat to my
might be hard to find than
but let's try it working out the different uh the designs okay the functional design tsk
so any other questions
uh from her side i don't think co uh
there's to many not questions
thinking
you can thank interested ferrer time being sold and uh
f_t
thirty to the marketing uh for the marketing side just to to give an idea with the managers looking for
book
but looking for or uh
a remote control to um excuse me the fact
whoa
go
have assailed price of twenty five euro
with a production price so uh tone half a euro
from what uh i think from war trying to find which one we're looking for i don't think the price is exactly
in the mark
d_c_t
okay now i'll explain myself here now or in the sense that uh
in the recent survey you this
uh from the ages from from fifteen to thirty five eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something is fancy this train it
twenty five euros uh the s_t_p
what's a prison reasonable cause it's more proprietary
yeah for gonna take away ask yeah
he'd push this up a bit
make it more spencer but give them added things that they don't happen now yep
then they would it could possibly so obvious that risk is there too expensive there not gonna buy
what
i think uh uh there's one other thing interesting to things it interesting idea
is that uh uh up from the fifteen to thirty five year old room
which are we spends more money on a train the new things
speech recognition is request
we're talking between he shape seventy five to ninety percent
of this group is one to pay you for speech recognition i am not
obvious we can make a remote to into a computer but may be simple commands
lower order
softer
on a off
that might be a possibility even note casts more
to be the first on the market to produce that's
thirty five percent say the two difficulty utes
so read freer we make an and more user friendly
uh of fifty percent said they can't find their remote half the time
so maybe one word speech recognition command save more mold and there's a beep beep beep and they can find it through you know ten ten the newspapers magazines whatever you have it all
but
not cost that uh the management is looking for a start gonna be possible
but it was trade if it's fanciest got some color to
is it for easy easy to use it as cat simple remote speech remote uh control
what piece of lower softer change channel
all on top off
remote because p. people like a fireman we'll without spending half a day looking for in getting all of cycling can turn the t_v on
so grab to look at it in
in this global wo idea
woods
the i. g. s.
and it does sure
oh design
price obviously we have to talk and
so what did think about uh
the design sec distant do you think you can make it or or
dip uh i'm sorry
or did you go about uh the design uh what was talking about speech recognition speech the destination
well aren't uh training is always an issue
main fan
commands and hm so um might to uh
it we can um
perhaps \'s um
can do it
if they use true as willing to
spend some time in the training process say could reduce the p_c
yeah un
the overall um
crossed
i'll sure how
but uh um any lame
uh um
uh i think all so that the this might impact the battery life
and it's am so maybe what we'll have to do is
um na add something where you can
recharge it
wirelessly
so that day you do you have any sense end power to it
so that or maybe yeah set out the sign in the tag you know gets a from the light
um as a solar cell inside they are show that uh you have enough
hand
deuce to do all these fancy things
it seems also like with the speech recognition yeah that's a great feature but if you're watching t. v. there's a lot of ambient sound an it's words it's not just you know noises like something hitting
i_ds actual speech so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough
to filter out the t_v ne speech
and the the user speech otherwise you can say remote but if someone on a screen as saying the same thing
always side and you have someone in a movie saying often here screen dies
i guess they've trigger the remote control and it's turned off or t_v
so
i think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of foul buttons
thing you had be a really good marketing gimmick but
thank we seriously need to consider how that within her
uh it's
the situation very could point
some one huh
with speech recognition uh
so no
h_m_m though
um good or bad idea but the and
if he'd so one more
recognition because i know telephones in cars and things i've seen in the stacy uh friend minuses column all i calls up mode
yeah
k. other radio can be on any everything
because i think's with speech recognition of uh uh remote whole like telephone
has her
exact to word it
that house to here
i don't think it would come through a sentence
no to low vision
somebody speaking on the said in the television uh stop and say
we're remote
um in a
so i think that uh something could be designed to recognize single new will oh yeah
uh yeah
well think it's a great idea
if we can design it and say this is used as a anyway stays with probabilities cull
joe or call it near the end
so once kind of cute
well what i can uh suggestive kristin okay yeah uh if you need some memory model
the technical we five
what's some try and
okay
or worked uh this facility especially for the speech recognition
i can be from a new some companies like uh interior or i_e um quickly because they're already in this uh speech recognition part okay
and they can maybe hell some uh technical backup from them some kind of for technical tire
okay uh if you want by can coordinate look it to get some information
okay indeed then uh let me know okay so what kind of uh
the details suited wide
okay too i had this future
in this project
i don't think gives uh the difficult
and the we need to know how much is the time frame you may need to do that
apart from or what he
true they
we'll get will find that out
come from your side there you have to go back to manage mons
yes the most precise me what do they want uh
paul risk
take a risk on the market something is gonna cost me one but couldn't per user released it may come home in the market
because a savvy something totally different hasn't always told you need something that nobody has right
yes can cast three end of the day you're the sales guys so i will come back and sit on your hard because you don't want to be real says projection okay
it's uh of course it's um with joe or tell the management how much it's costas and how much you're bunch event version okay
and uh so i don't mind to convey n_s_a okay the management to spain that some more money on the project okay if you can make a all pole
folders
money from this well why responses to i don't mind to come as though the management okay the management say this okay so that they don't want certain facilities which it's already war work if they want something the new okay i think uh like a speech recognition definitely there lately i don't think the signal for the shapes and uh i hope i can convince the management on
okay
so if you have any a new idea also queue for the uh you we can all us combine the you can tell me if you need any
uh as special okay or coordination of cubic linear technical company which you can uh
high-tech technology pack up
but create
put your function
but this one looked
simple design okay then i am very could go there
rain uh what's your comments about uh
uh room
well i'm maybe if i go through my presentation you can sort of see what the user perspective it is and how it ties into the other two comments yeah
so you'll finish apparent uh so i can uh
okay i hear a note uh we can
spinning
schools
huh participant
yeah jen
to fit
let's see to be home and that's fine
i'd pay
s. so
may sickly
the method the we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like it when people don't like about existing products so in our case existing remote controls
and then what the good ideas are in what the bad ideas are and why they're bad and good which isn't always is obvious we seem to have intuitions about why
things are good or things are bad but when you look
technically at how it works sometimes or that's not the case
then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep his that'll feed into both
ads work anchor stearns works
um and then or what the remote control should look like obviously once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are
so in terms of the functionalities that we need you obviously need to be able to turn the t_v on and off we need to change channels both by directly going to a specific channel bar by channel surfing you need to build to control the volume and then control any menus on the t_v
to regulate contrast or whatever
so the problems that people have expresses at there's too many buttons on remote controls in general
the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do ill
um off n. b. need to know specific button sequences
to get certain functionalities time um which you don't necessarily always remember especially if it's a functionality that you don't use a very off and
and that the buttons are too small but
so here we've got two example as where
here on the left hand side you can see a remote control that had lots and lots of buttons the buttons been a lot of cases are tiny
um they're hard to t_e and okay they're labeled but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much whereas on the other side you have a much simpler remote control
that i think basically has the minimum functionality is
that are he need it and it sort of looks simpler and just
less imposing when you first look at it so i would be inclined to goes served words this
in terms of designer rather than there s.
and it to specific functionalities are require more buttons or we can figure how to do it with existing
um buttons
so my personal preferences i had to keep the number of buttons to a limit are two minimum sorry
make frequently use buttons bigger and more strategically place so like the on button being really obvious one
the channel changing in the volume
and to keep the design basically sleek can simple
which i think ties into white christine and adam both sad
fairly be simply
um so that's pretty much air it and
i know if you guys have any
question it's or or
alright so uh um it seems to me very understandable there the your research and uh
and now as the heading in the same direction then
he hand uh um
uh
the one thing that i saw a missing for um about your your research that we found was this uh ability defined the doggone thing when you need it yes that's true so uh you know but that's okay that's why we're all your table so that if we think of in our research indicates certain things and and
go with it's complementary
how also think then it's um
uh
the from uh the feel of it
is uh a
when you hold it
is some thing then it's an
was expressed and more and in in in my uh
design oh and that's logical and normal \'cause those are the parameters the industrial designers more thinking about that we had the look and the feel
and uh that's definitely very important factor especially to users who are gonna be in line with thing and then the using it almost done
daily basis and a lot of cases i'd thing
m_l tense i have any questions sounds good
so
for anybody need uh any help p_r_m for time b.
one this the subjects okay so
this come back to mean and uh distant maybe i can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical
other companies to help before um a could design uh slim
okay enter to add some futures like what we're talking for the speech recognition at all
should read maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include \'cause we thrown a lot of features onto the table but
do we actually want to incorporate pollen them for
can be missed anything
doing the bump and look at the closing slide maybe that would provide some guidance
sent
has ni tell us uh
really this is enlarged was decision individual actions
it says the user if there so i supposed to do the components concept
suppose to work on the user interface concept and you suppose to keep watching the trends
uh um in specific instructions will be sent by a ah
culture
i thought we shouldn't do was the main features just to start with all of them right now on eliminate them later in the process as my suggestion
okay for that will be great
and uh i'll send you uh images object if you want x.
i'm just thinking in terms of time but she's injected
yes no not acting now they move
i just thinking is they really practical to start designing something with features that were just gonna end up throwing away i mean it takes a lot of
time anaphora it
for every when to
consider different features at
um
and use if we spend their time and effort on line features that we're not gonna use maybe it's better to spend it
on the tho
you thinking more about features that we actually do want but
oh by the ginger reasons nine for after the meeting because we are meeting time is run at somebody else you gotta use this round and you know we can't hang out here yeah matter this so
okay what do this logo will take for lunch break placate then uh we can discuss for the more
okay with our courteous and again it can find
uh no
so thanks for coming and uh i sentiments of meeting and uh please which are all information in the shelling for less so everybody can share the information
okay okay
so let's go for want stuff
in glee very much
book
a cut
hm from
hm
oh wait com but
hope to light
i hope were you heard it would lunch
yeah
f_f_t
uh this is meetings you may i can tell she uh to discuss about the
c_e sip sure
design me tea
if p.
and uh i jen no will be
don't want me i and uh makes uh
a product manager or secretary that's me and the the presentations from the \'cause steve
and he'll
are gonna this
and then missy pair
finally in this meeting be have to this size
and you know to pick it decision on the remote control
concepts
i and uh
the function of this line
so we ow forty minutes
nothing gets uh
attribute uh low but i i hope we can finish it up
so i'll hand oh to the un
the functional team to the kristin we're here to discuss about uh the components
const at
okay
so uh a few good open and the powerpoint presentation
i'm member too
two
components design
so uh could put it in slide show amount yeah
my grade here
a set little that one yes please thank you
it's
so oh why um
and we were looking you specifically uh the components uh the following components
uh the case the power supply him
uh i means of communications with the television set
and then since we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition you have to have microphone what na dementia haven't
have to have mike front in the device
but um
maybe you did have it
away has to has to hear if the speaker
and um so could be in the television set could be in that device but somewhere you have
put the microphone
um and know a way of making beeps or sounds you can find it when it's gets lost
um so the other ones thing that we
soap
i'm method fur
going about this is we've looked at uh out there is stored in the historical record what's worked with hasn't
and then we all so oh well um
the wind evaluates to new materials in we contacted manufacturing for their input because
course remo
might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies capabilities to offer s. so i'll this is the approach that we took during our um her research
so well um for the case
um there we told we were making this best case specific assumption that it would be curved in design course no i wanted it to be expand the ball end shrink a_b_l but
uh m. that it doesn't seem to be one of the choice not an option we can
li can really seriously explore
so then we with thinking about um the rubber but um
and fortunately a_s_p alimony because of the heat uh factor and then um there might be some
problems with than uh how wits
can goes with the board
uh and uh then step plastic also has this problem of melting and is brittle i guess brittle after a while so um still had titanium in in word available
but um and fortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh than people in manufacturing m_s_d that could make it curved cases that have titanium although
howl
apple did it with group
powerbook i'm not so quite sure but
uh never less so um they've eliminated all of our options except what i'd
so
i am at this
planet is she said it's an environmentally friendly uh material so
were it were
ling a propose think
uh i will get to all my personal preferences in just a second
so that this this other matter of the chips and them well we could use a simple design on the board but
uh the simple chips but that's only works for the bayes you don't give very much um intelligence with the simple one
and um the um that was their regular which
i regret that i've forgotten exactly we
why a uh i'm eliminating that one
uh the other option no was this advanced chip-on-print
and uh so we like do we we found
edit it includes his infrared sender which would member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip
and uh manufacturing as told us that they've um uh recently developed a a uh a sensor and a speaker that would dead be integrated into this advanced chip-on-print so
uh would wer at
now gem ping right to our personal preferences
well i'm yeah i i'd really think we should you know use some of us some really exotic words
like um would you know we
uh well you guys can from tropical country so you can can think of some trees and some nice words
i think that
people will might really want to design their own cases you see they could do sort of a this um three dimensional design on the internet and then they could submit their borders can like you similar custom car or de you know and you can choose the color the size of the wheels and the colors of the leather and things like that and then i uh i think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip
so this is uh finding in so far resurgent my recommendations
uh um for the new remote control wound would be to have um
have be made out of wood
he many problems with that
can go back uh once flying
i'm not sure how i know i know the seed let's go back up here this uh
i'll cost chain uh
what's mean exactly eight wants a chip
won't
frame for seeming okay
i think it's um the not um i'm multiple uh chip design
um in it so uh maybe printed on to the circuit board
uh i could find out more about that was there before the next fit next meeting is it all know mike was michael will supply store uh
i don't know but i'll find out more and next week it will that would be good so the find or load but modified to remove this so that would be cool sounds good
going with the plastic going into those are possible to because um
it gets brit hole
crack ps
h_m_m
an um
we want we expect the use um in
and these remote controls to be around for several hundred year p_c
so we've
anyway get
it got it
good expression in his regime
well they after a set
ho
oh i'm the speak for yourself i will
a pop up
and he quit the window you run into the same types of problems with me i mean it chat set if you drop but
it's i'm not edge
he oops
three hundred combines action i read it is
yeah but i think in the cell if you really do you guys really good quality work that it might work but you can't just you know
you'll see when you get to julia making use of the words are hard text yeah things and way but there's some very creative output
oh i'm that's actually very innovative idea
okay good could yeah
such are having a hard time keeping remote control of my uh it's
but it's actually a very aware that different idea that uh you you can choose your color would
three type a womb
hm
staying in a meets each person getting other personalized individualized
speech recognition remote control in wood
\'s
not on the market
slightly too easily slide the the design the functional design uh what are what you mean
i am me
in terms of comments on their surgeries as my own uses a while
don't moments closed
she works in the cubicle next or easter she's actually this already a little bit prepared for this uh
what that we added what's now i'd i wouldn't
in patent
t.
hoping get the quality materials are then
it shouldn't influence the design principles to match which you'll see with my presentation went think we'd have to check those with the users whether
how quickly the novelty wears off from not having you would wanna have tab splinters in your yeah value for example
says oh
have to see how
kid friendly it in send
and all on that but
so like if you'd dog gets a hold of it they could use it
i'd
per t. think
i do that a with rubber plastic so
yeah they do it will you
a p_c materials as well yeah
c_m_l more
okay then uh let's mood to uh i'd me
ship
known bugs in chile
\'s one
okay sent
so it's a very short presentations i'm actually gonna dry you the layout on the board so
if you wanna discuss stricter the second sly
uh and push basically shows sort of i took the ideas that we're talking about last time
um in try to put that
into the remote controls the things that you can actually see on a a are the on off switch
volume and channel control the many access but na
ergonomic shape which i completely agree with chris teens idea to have it sort of moulded so it's slightly more ergonomic incomparable to hold than the standard very straight remote controls
actually other thing with the word if we take your customizing idea yeah
is that people can actually do sort of quality measurements on their hand size of someone has larger hand my my illness was why different size on your as for example
so that's actually really guide f. testimony customize ability
um one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen i just like you have one flit fonts
so that you don't have this case where someone said some bit of remote controller accidentally pressed her hand non especially if you have little kids around they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch t_v sharon accidentally change channel or during um
elf so
uh you had issues of the batteries earning at so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life light
on it that kinda goes demand him and emma as your batteries starts die
uh and in terms of invisible feature is audio in um tactile feedback on button passes um um and like you said speech recognition
so in terms uh than what
his they might actually learn by
despite working in interface design not the various errors in the browser active are different
who has something like this well
on off switch fairly they've
sort of in a corner and by itself
so you don't accidentally turn your t_v off either transmit over there but it is
and then you had a sort of one of those topple displays
color
channels
and um all you and
so the for surfing channels and then volumes of volume maybe the up-and-down
known those up and down and then channel structure right
i then here you high you're sort of standard
telephone ish
number of her
and then on one side in would have an access to the menu
on your t_v
and on the other side
i'll way to turn off the voice control
so that if the user doesn't want to user voice a can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control on accidentally
changing things on yeah
um so you could have a little out see you write somewhere
oh clever
n.
means
i dealt for
so as you can see it's a very very simple design which is one of the things i really wanted defeat
just keep it simple not have too many buttons not have too many functionality strode into it
think the design can pretty much carry over to everything although with the word the flip screen
like you half to do something slightly
i hinge
we like a copper he and sure yeah we just have to start watching of in a way it's depending on how much the the flip-screen why it away from
um i dunno control on it to start getting to have
but that's the general way out little journal functionalities
not a something else
as you can see there's still lots of space that tax for a baseball
i'd if you do it customize it maybe
we could make this thing fairly small uh by age
don't know in
personal convinces
so
that's pretty much
all i had to say or mean everything else in terms of designing issues
i'm the centering of the keypad and
the channel is just depending on where your thumb it is
and to do tend to use the the volume control and down
the browsing more than the actual number pad so that would be sort of interact liner for your thumb goes when you hold in your remote control
the number pad little bit lower \'cause it's used less frequently h_m_m um
so once we decide exactly what we want to then we can figure out the zap positioning
but more or less he can which you go along those lines
so what's you are uh
okay comments or uh
simple design
so customers want
pre
sounds like he's to know we have a product either
it
problems obviously gonna be cost
h_m_m
okay i also hope so
very simple
presentation is cut from the marketing point you have to see what the consumers a lot
i'll so i'll uh
copied uh
different top over remote
f. you
fine me
or write bat
i showed b. one and here
but
trend
watch
sh are
some be a modified
we're studio for it
women gimme simple
questionnaires and every errors because there was obviously we have to see whether commas consumers are looking for today axis uh trends change very very quickly
and six mas maybe this idea has already gone out the window so that's gonna question how fast we can act
uh they already arrest dressed or mael
no
yeah go to find norms no
so it would only doing
oh the market train them
this is what window from the last uh from mine
questionnaires and level although server is we've done fancy feel good that's what we were looking for something that feels good in the hand that's easy to use
looking for next generation of innovation because all the remotes out there now there are all very similar they all do the same thing
yet or something completely
\'kay
easy to use as always become has become mind other major interest that uh
with the white board we can see it's a remote that's easy to use
and i think this is another thing is interesting is a consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting cell technology
so we even have we or product that may be more expensive
if he comes our right
if they didn't you look at looks and feels good and has technology
the second to you you can see the last one is a very easy in simple design
the second wonders about uh uh forty five thousand different buttons on it which makes it fairly hard to read per or i do use the first one i see
but they put elan display
and the something else uh with will flip up now wearing what kinds of things simple way to flip-open table display on the flip-open one close it everything's locked
yeah
maybe the display also makes it easier to use because sometimes he knew like in for buttons maybe if you see a display
context sense it and instructions
oh okay ending a much better but no the t_v or the davey d. or something else i've seen specially mostly the standard really sounding speech rally engine yeah you have one with a very simple also the idea is simple but with the display
so you could see which are don
so maybe fig in incorporate the easiness of use
trained e. fancy
feels good this
uh
with a display
would designer would design a callas
you might be magic or d. s. m.
somebody oh waters the device
need kids send them like um
he and
uh
some sort of for phone uh rubber
uh um
older yeah and then they would squeeze it they would take the shape of their hand yeah so that it's really molded to his ears were sitting there and then you would know like
um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh core these queasy
or resist
i know really
it's rather
but that for that you got saturday sort of an average across families and that's right and so you would not less than everyone has their own personal remote on that that actually would do increase the um the resonator
it it yeah it
through joe
no but incorporating the three uh
how we see be something totally new on the market
yeah
totally differ it but
full already the customize ability it is
a really good sir diff
when you get weighted uh result nokia the chemo it
change a ball colors
um yeah taking marking for another phase take it off chronic depression
and and that's a male so yeah millions
male yields
x_l
so with of the the find is when the research is easy to use something totally new
we had come up with something totally new that's not on
it also have to work um consider that to who we were can get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing process system i
one and learn about uh um label glottis
you know in different countries since to force so we can do it cheap but don't wanna exploit uh labor in um
third world can truce
to actually could turn it you turn around and say that you're um part of the reason the cost is high for the devices because
um you're paying yeah a working way each to the person who made
the device
when but we can get a production in uh
countries like uh custom anyways yeah yes and just like in the or chain our male she also
you can you will better futures and but applies and you can some more
through
that what that that be something that manufacturing would have to
yeah um
yeah explorer more and and as to where where many fashion is is
than of the stuff
yeah more you're to design
yes uh but uh come up with the icsi product you can talk about the production later sequence on the the quantity of the um um so we don't need to have a only one uh fabric factory or something so we can have a carpeted room
the glue the fabric okay with the different uh electronics items then we can have it
business trial uh in go-there quite the cost
to soul more
so
but to let let's decide first about uh components concept tend uh interface concept
could be could is
except a full for both of you what uh ed was talking
an your designed
with uh you wanted the display all without display or just to simple so
i think it depends i mean i think it's a good idea ab but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because the theoretically with the t_v you already have
a big display right in front of yao
um we
so
if we're tied to keep costs down
then maybe sacrificing the display way
um
is a way to go i mean depends on how much putting a display cost and when it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for on um \'cause if it's only used for one little thing than putting in a big display case verb in display that's
probably expend so just to do the training on the chat
for their uh speech recognition or whatever
may not be the most cost efficient waiting go but
that's just sort of speculation i mean
would you think n. g. in
he like the display and one of the concepts it you show
um do you know how much a const uh
uh um
to to add an oval display like the n_s_a right
so a
when taken action i am so fine down
h_m_ms
as we have to find out cost taught
hell com
sorry about that last no problem i'm your from pushing it after is made
i well marketed
what's we get a price on it then we
marketer
so there
the advanced chip on print is but uh um
we'll we've
but we've decide
it we've determined in the uh
engineering industrial design is the recommendation
and um think leave kinda come to some
agreement we're guarding um
this concept eval wouldn't case
h_m_m
a customizable or on
lies me
config hardly what about you will but this with
when the buttons be wait \'til uh
uh i don't think so so now i think they could be rubber glacier now so you have that old hat little experience of
yes old
well what we'll do is uh we'll we'll stick with uh the simple design for time being until uh at find notes about uh how much it's cost of extra in case people for the display
okay so maybe what you can do is um boat off you you can come up with uh
the program \'kay
both people more doesn't okay
okay
sheer
so well i um
are we done this mean
uh i hope at of or is it okay uh they will have come up with the prototype design
okay then they can show you how rig looks like and then we can uh submit to the
i'd have some it to the management
so it kate
then in that and you can come with a price how much it's costas extra for the uh the display
and i'm marketing strategy to be sure that you extract the flotilla
on the pyre
you can fill extra
of course you'll make money total so
not only by your mate when it will your commission
okay saw any questions
so by next meeting so please come of it uh the per type
okay and uh can we can present thing yeah
who group
oh
so thanks for all your uh have facts
end coming for the meeting again
and in the c. soon
okay okay thank y'all
it's uh n.
i can
yeah okay
oh the reader delay
us
well mike everybody
sure
this synth
so this meeting agenda be can mutate
designed meeting
hi and uh
opening in the p. of the second of the me minutes uh prototype presentation from uh the t_e
in uh
ach neat
oh ins
yes sane the evolution clarity yeah
the finance said it's uh from my side from the management and uh production evaluation
then uh closing so me how forty minutes
to discuss
i and uh finalize and
lowe's
the our product from project
and to move for the
so
okay unless talk about uh maybe have first uh
can-do prototype
don't okay
so an hand or two
i don't know presentation but are pretty much covers work that we path down so
if i'm missing anything kristin show gently ran his me to do
yeah he's even
okay we'll we'll too
yeah mime
it's not the biggest power point presentation normal
so it two or three you're free
don't think it's the last time and call
uh done
no
then is is like look at that one
final design
yeah it is named appropriately you just couldn't see any
um okay can aim
on us
\'s
alright \'s so
from them when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting we decided that we wanted and their ergonomic shaped the material that we chose was weight
and that the color would be customizable you can staying there went
whatever a color
uh um
so in terms of function in yeah to be able to turn the t_v on and off volume or channel control menu control voice recognition control
and we've incorporated the l. c. d. screen on the flat panel as part of the design if we figure out it's too expensive problems to get i
um so
turn them bail
far lover products
this see it is
our remote control
with the flip panel is you can see
set if you left tap
the panel
you can save their lovely yellow l. c. d. gets
uh um
so actually hard to open the yellow button you have is the on off button so it's really big hard to mess
you have the un
they're read their um
triangles at the toggles war
changing the volume sir out
volume are up down volume down
the green there are the channel changing
zen that's when others very light very touchable displays
and then you have the numeric pad
then the darkly with the bottom
and \'s all in
the right hand so i do you have
the access to the menu on the t_v and on the left ten sided
he who herve
p. yeah
the the ability to turn off the voice or recognition
sox is pretty much what we had on the whiteboard the last time
um and uh horowitz is
yeah out additional feature on the back
is you can have your own customized
backing and i suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on a friend's
so that you can really make this a highly highly customizable remark intro
we haven't uh um
uh specified where the speaker where the microphone will be placed
that depends um us design of a circuit board inside and uh what room is left
um yeah
i think the microphone is well on the twelve
uh yes that okay there
and it of flip
so that will with the sieve
so
when it the chip
it's not on the chip but because you need to home mike
followed system them it depends on the design of the circa board
yes but he shouldn't be under the flip either because you can have the remote control close but you still might want yeah
well that's activate it by voice yeah but uh
my opinion anything that's but under the flip because when all you want to
the total cool kids would then you can speak then you can close it
leave reported on uh on the fly for k. then uh
yeah technical ah i don't think it's a feasible
because most of the time use big then it will be recognized if you've already got the remote control your hand or need to open the flip to use a voice why use the voice why not just use your hand
i mean the whole point of the voice is that of the d_m_t controller sitting there and i'm too lazy to reach over and pick it out
i can just use my voice as the gap my hand in the popcorn bowl and um holding my couple coca call and the other hand
yeah
we don't wanna like go up either marketing
flip the
i mean it doesn't have to be on the flip it can be on the side closer versailles sides movies works with that's great and so i mean i can pass around it
yes its own wants to know
yeah very pakistan with a nap again
over she
this paper microphone on the side there would have been are probably would have been not be diminished or anything to be accessed um all the time to voice
yeah and zen my
so if been doing
san him
couple mas to the artist
it's um um it
you just work on the wait a little bit oh
yeah synth
yeah maybe the shape of the buttons the little um so it take shape simons
domestic and sadness past looks more hello heavily but uh ten minutes compared to the other demon with sort of less weight
i mean this is fast the scene there's only so much you can do it we could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well
backed
and part of the thing is at will
a lot of people say that they don't like something that's to lie because they don't feel like they have enough control over right
it's i mean maybe this is excessively happy
i think he needs have some might he needs to feel like you're still holding something
so that's pretty much it for a presentation actually do or replied more that
think that's good
thank you or much
so any comments saw uh
new prototype uses rule within this on it i'd use it
talked a bottom previous meetings
they'll goes to his his next phase is the financial
this third uh to uh
so i'd come back to the un
so they were used and criteria i think uh that would be good
so in
let's come to the finance i have some uh calculations which are made uh as for her to her
the bike checked
so here you can look like uh the energy source and uh handy to animal and uh and if taken solar cells
uh which optional us some all option there and at once the chip-on-print that's what uh we were talking about that
so
then we have sample sensor in flashes he could
then there'll be no complementary
then special color led
i'd push-button
so it uh actual our budget was uh twelve point five euro but uh it's coming to nine point nine four you'd also be or and uh below the budget
okay so still veil saving some money
i think it's uh would figure if
yes grainy
rice it
installation insane should well we haven't got the my yet so i
anyone enveloping it does cut the cost one way to market it as it
so maybe it's for some money we can utilize for order uh marketing
the sales so okay yeah and uh
which is the pens are boring ave
oh alden this
p_r_m
per version or a cost analysis we do not have an l. c. display
they'll see display is gonna be very expenses can do
but it's not filled in star does just we'll have the present yeah yeah yeah okay sorry
so if we add the a parse only two to three year old
poll
or remote
now or or per round about twelve tall and a half
as to what
uh the cup buddy
had initially um request
so that means we can put the new uh this billions be in
this for tsk
production uh on line putting about question because we're talking to non profit also
uh mine you'll see uh uh
the problem with uh our survey the the possibility of how many units can be saul what percentage of the market et cetera cetera because at all this has to be taken it
in to consideration
uh this is just production cost it is not uh advertising cost is not transportation in cost uh
yes are still uh we had talked one point they have will inflate yes
pointed bit
the cost to the outer cast of the unit
you for the can't but
so the come up with what the company wants is a fifty million
hell
profit
we'll have to let it
this we are talking about one unit functions also ended going to look quantity
okay
and the cost will come dong
slide both customization because this is being them in an though on on order basis might be uh that the quantities walls moan and try the circuit board will yeah you're right would be produced in quantity but the cost of the case would uh
been be fixed it the
uh you get some pretty cheap labor they can do this case full one euro
x. files really that's the cost material analytical
has truly
stan
ending
but any oh still we are under control okay so what uh i windows i will try to negotiate with the vendors quickly took it uh
the production cost less okay so that we can since some money
okay to put in with our marketing more uh we know the from motions whatever
okay
so that uh i would look often i mean speak to the man and maintain the computational some more uh
cost all
if we can go to to my display lee
i'm will come back to your words
\'cause just to give
m. embody an idea of the market
it's now on a scare everybody out of this project
in it
if i'm still here press um a person yeah
you um whole
yep
for abuse me is gonna be a train watch
this is same when you did before
or shouldn't be
and now softer right now
no
think that's is not the same when you have to go back and find another one
whatever he neighbor
popped up by
oh uh functional try functional might not be you you can normalcy
yeah mikes like it there
yep that's in seoul color screen by screen
oh no all
since so we need to have some trouble ideal market uh we had independent study the says it does this market has availability them so what we'd need eight million units per year
okay
our internal company evaluation puts a between eight to nine million which is approximate the same as independence day
um so free continuum
and look at the findings
neck screen
which means that uh if we have a target of two million with the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in there for sheer
which is actually a tremendous m. l. yeah
i'm no keeping com
nor changing
oh maybe they already expect so if we put an inflated price of fifty your or your production cost they cannot exceed
twenty five euro or okay we're already in yeah there
prior ages
okay would trails poor
promotion labor because we i mean maybe included the promotion in the cost
um transport for the material to distortion wood or our home over break this down between our
how are retailers
twenty five percent of the market to get to two million units are two mania notes we have to have a profit of twenty five euro per unit to get to the fifty million year you your profit
yep
how okay
soul
obviously remember i just to to bring down the evaluation of the forum
the phase uh fancy stylish knows of the of the unity ease of use
speech recognition
cost we've gone through these no the company most of value it
the feasibility of beauty able to take enough for the market
to just a flame production
what would project there's over to viewers
but be that the market changes we revert quickly maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from
so we know we have to come move decision
kane the company still to me in your answer
can it still with
for fifty euros could our gonna findings
um
i would uh like to explore the possibility of you seeing an alternative
um delivery in sales channel which would be um to use the internet i was thinking the thing for emotion and ordering and then to drop ship the product to the customer as residents that we have no storage yet no um you do have transportation instead of the labor cost which you don't have the transport to the
um point of sale yes yeah point of sale is to online
yeah you'd do a shipping center somewhere
or strategically placed shipping centers rather minimize might yeah
that's on syntax should sell through am assigned to hillary and bill very well yes yeah
as an idea and going to work uh um
two hundred more fulfilled and boat's keel technology uh we're we're you know selling yeah yeah
you neat products uh
and actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customizable \'cause on the web people can look at the diff options they have
see maybe what other people have done one the range of possibilities that's where is if you're in a store are
you can't
i'm less here highly imaginative
purse then you may not really know what it is you want whereas on the web if you have a bunch of pictures it can serve trigger ideas and
and you can even have a and um movie that you can rotate the object and look at the uh no i think you're missing really is they the way you wanted to the feel of the product
bucked
we're getting used to then snuck quite like trying on issue but
people are getting used divine things on mine they can't touch
a four star on down through with the watches to you can customize what you could see how it is that's the end of the production you can change it uh
is a lot of long wave it is doing this no
you're rude to look on it and work this way
as possible do this maybe there's a possible of selling more than two minute someone you wish
she's a believe feasibility uh
well with the price um hm
can
great
and in this uh from well we will put uh
okay then uh let's wait for the production okay then uh you can evaluate the product so well with books like technically in the room
uh go via
what turnaround time doing uh
c_e new production evaluation and what you were very very quick or very rarely so it's it's really great
of course so it will uh come back into weeks
maybe would includes
forks for me what evolution and okay
prototypes you main
yes there have now um more adult product evaluation
well should just some market tests uh once we have prototypes into some borders and things like that in
test market it um
through another marker for people to do indeed do this he gave them in give his will make some form it's minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use
it's not trivial talks is because we are we are not going to do to know all quality okay so we can no no for what we definitely shouldn't do it looks attribute
so looted the uh other place
and i don't think it strict modern problems time
okay so that's uh real production will stored once we product evolution
okay been yeah
it's not who phone uh
the technical team and uh
your team
okay
or from a management
the meeting one
more uh
file if it
anyhow standing
say any any other uh questions or uh comments to be
this goes
now huh i
think with great much covered everything
okay it's well did you have something like just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation and what about time for a redesign
yeah fo
the users come back and tell us no this is bad this is bad we want the stand differently
okay a uh
let's take like this fits posted with this more to locate for the for the
market introduction okay so no more changes would be maple okay
him this
the basic design
i p.
we will introduce me this modern-day in the let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers then
we can uh bow for the
second generation you dilution
\'kay tsk
there's not end there's no limit
the problem is there'll be no it was like a generation of the first generation flanders for some silly reason and
get a customer i had that how then will idea
they'll the law taste
okay it's a that is annoying
does no leavitt
no but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally task data and fine-tune distill
and general range of requirements verses releasing a product that
we think will work but we don't really have anything to bags out pacific
yeah so that's it is and you are here for uh the design
okay i hope you wouldn't has let right i'm not
everybody i mean the whole point um user evaluation is to see what real people need we have our own motivations in mine we have brown ideas in mind but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell
yeah but uh see we oughta take a few consideration so can only the price consideration one of the few to consideration okay like uh you can you tell you can audit module i can even more chilly okay
so he it's a depends on the individual taste
you know so we have yeah out to balance somewhere
yeah of course and just trying to point out that i think that year evaluation and redesign turnaround time it's too
short well you have new redesign not you personally but
yeah and apart it would have i dunno doesn't it
redesign timing c_ds
yeah it
to do you know what season of the year time of the here's the most important for t_v remote control sales
would it be the christmas season by any chance the spores time sports sees him
or before which is boards all my hope
a little ones yeah
so soccer's maybe those the we've already have been in work occupied it needed to be
to we can remote control
so i think what we need to do is perhaps just synchronized the final though the launch of a user tested device with some special of meant yeah that's a good idea and then um so that gives us a little more time perhaps than we anticipated because
i don't know when the well cup this but i'm sure there's gonna be one major sport
oh another might major sports event probably not the um the football games coming at the end of january i think that might be a little too aggressive if yeah uh but
so i'm just take a pointing out uh uh i a strategy to uh do some additional user testing the press and then to lodge
um added a major sports event or uh perhaps two at all still in place to advertise that tivo and to work with motion pictures and there might be some motion picture so that are coming out
um then that are coming out on d. v. d. that uh they need to have a didn't special remote control to work with it so we could maybe work out campaign with uh with sony pictures for example maybe some management has got
i have relationships there we can my for each yes uh that of course uh i'm convinced amounting to do that
that's great
there's just something to keep in mind is this really really avoid a lot of products have gone out there without being popular user test that i completely flopped when in fact he gets re released a few years down the line that with proper testing and it takes off like crazy
disposable diapers is an example of that in fact anyway he has started his in one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years there was a disposable consumer product
and ab
people the market
head that really
got non to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away because it wasn't there
but then when they re launched in thirty years later they were virtually the same design but people had gotten a throw away you know paper caps in nap get all kinds of things that
they hadn't ten um so yeah you're right timing is very important but i think we've got a good product
yeah the cities and added pseudo that's right from or uh the brown back here
on the whole well it
it's gonna be very important of it company
we were behind the scene n. he's uh friends clean so yeah
he'll be he's three
don't wait paper
good luck you
to deadlock
all marketer uh
you look very relaxed be considering yeah and of the uh
sort raise
others see yeah
okay so then uh that's come to uh closing recently worry cost within the budget
i and uh is the project evaluated okay so that will uh comes so
okay via the but there are time beings uh tags for all your efforts and play pool okay in the great design
and there are let's leave it to the act later for once production this
war and the mean that um that some verbs
so let's meta uh this evening to wrangle
flows on working
sounds good so good banking nice working with your data about
he'll
thank a game called key
as
i see only an input delay us only use the wrong
who
um
or port
t_n
oh huh
hm
