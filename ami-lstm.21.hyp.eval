um
one day or something
yeah
uh huh
oh
okay
so yes yeah
and uh
oh yeah it
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh
okay good morning everybody will like you know come back at least to start this team
um i'm gonna have a little powerpoint presentation for us for kickoff meeting
my name is rose linger and i'll be the project manager
um our agenda is we're gonna do a little opening and then um we'll talk little bit about the project both into acquaintance education major little bit including the tool training exercise
i'm going into the project plan do a little discussion
in classes we only have twenty five minutes
first of all our project age um we're creating a new remote control which we have three calls about it needs to be original trendy and user friendly
i'm hoping that we're gonna work together to achieve all three of those
um so we're gonna divide this up in a three
and come back and clean hearts
first the functional design which will be
um for so do individual work um to meeting the conceptual design individual work in a meeting
and then the detailed design individual work and the meeting
so that we need to be doing our own ideas we're coming together
um
collaborating
okay we're gonna get to know each other little bit
so um what we're gonna do start after
hm
let's start off with me and um
um i lehman sorry only one
um we're gonna do a little tool training so we're gonna work out whiteboard by trying to uh
introduce yourself um say one thing about yourself and a dry favorite animal and tell us about it
okay
uh
you know which one of these like between really need
probably not
alright so this is a job writing what have you guys have whatsoever
but uh he introduced himself when he was okay
okay
uh
so
well stated made me less than doing actually some studies
uh well i'm having artistic talent
how you spell your name
okay
yeah
be
oh i guess i'm the industrial designer
right
so if i can get
and uh
okay
well uh
terrible
uh
this is a this is enhance the variable it is
well
i think they're
joe
a pre relational government
oh geez
yeah
yeah
so what are your favorite characteristics
uh i i like having fish okay
um
it's
quite a cool area all around where you got um
quite decorative well animals they can so they can
they're very adaptable
they carry everything i mean without
um
i mean there is a job
actually
so you just go around a table
like our whole lives in uh
uh done the user interface designer
project
um
oh yes
trying to work uh
oh i should develop your your original because it might be nice to have martin c. nine
um
a remote control
what's this
is that this by the phone
somewhere around
in the world to see the man's gonna go to the
uh the other is like well this is 'cause uh
uh
well for school require televisions
also the
the hamsters
we don't really know much about
what was those
the work
rooms
they just go
uh
oh
captions
hm
ah i unjustly i um
around he's the ash started off
yeah yeah
and and uh she uh
fantasy sort of field and
very helpful
yeah
really wow
oh
just
yeah
you know why
how
uh sooner than i see uh
i don't know yet or what
oh
who who might go
they make supposed to these idiots
he no matter what uh i play uh we uh
uh they uh they like spread
every time
okay yeah
try to pretend that we can do about that
uh
yeah
hm
okay i wrestle about her passion manager
i'm from california
i mean
which
but
see
it's definitely significantly harder when you're doing it okay
oh that's a area
that's right
that's a passenger
which is now
listen to you
yeah
you both
i agree
uh
oh yeah
yes
i uh
and the red cross you can always say see how many in chinese
all the time
so i really enjoyed it
i'm just thinking and they're really beautiful animals too
okay um moving on to
slightly more serious
i could talk about project finances
um with a couple of
we'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro and what the profit aim of
um
fifty million euro um for our sales and because this is such this is for television that's the with market range of internet like it's an international market range we don't have to worry about specifics
um
in order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve
fifty years ago
so we're selling it for twice
what we'd like to use it for
okay um
just to generate over the discussion about the project um i could i'd like to hear about your experiences using remote remote controls
um being first ideas about um creating a new
no control
but would be the best
um where you uh what are the features that you really like what features that you don't like
et cetera
seven
oh i hate when there's like
for every button that you have to pass to uh actually turn on the t_v like you have to do one for the power of the t_v and then like
another one to get the actual screen and then make us go about going in and out now they keep combining
all different
remotes together and i don't know if i
necessarily like that particular trend of
to multimedia overload and just one last t_v um
we get past some sort of like
device to help me find it
i used to use remote controls things like
t_v you see do you play uh
it's a video recorder
uh it's
i guess the the pretty neat little tools that you don't have to get up and what could possibly change each other
so especially if you have someone really lazy like me either
pretty nice
um
i find them they can be a bit annoying
especially
like i know if i'm watching t_v i have
after three separate remote controls have info reader one for the t_v one for the digital box
one for the video recorder as well
um
and also they tend to
that tend to be a bit confusing to put too many buttons on them
oh
uh
to to sort of
two sort of complicated splendid
what i really wanna do is switch on and off to change channel changeable
yeah um
i agree with
having too many remotes around my dad has a whole bunch more at home of remotes for various things i don't know how to work out for them
um
the what's important for me i guess is that it's easy to use
and
that there's not too many buttons they're not too small you know
yeah you need to and to know what you're doing
and one thing i particularly like is
if you're not um sort of moving it around to get it to work on infrared yeah um i think there's a way around that
but i know in my residence right now the
television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get into non so it's just simpler
just to just turn on the t_v itself and i think that's
if you're gonna make a remote control it should actually work for what it's doing
about like batteries and things like that because there's some amount of the top
don't require
like batteries or do a remote require batteries
um how to measure all them but we could
but possibly could use like a lithium battery uh yeah so that would last a lot longer than double a is uh like that doesn't batteries are used in a lot of um in between players analogously hm
uh
oh it's it's a little bit of conflict over um
yeah combining all the remotes could together versus having
by different remotes
so um
like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote and yeah you don't wanna have five remotes
so how do we work with that
could we get something that
just has
no it doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or
program it's other things that i'm not
pretty coherent about
but that just has your major buttons
for that work for everything you know volume control the on-off
channel changing
maybe that's specially divides it so it's like you look if you're trying to get the t_v on that's not the topic on the remote i don't know maybe vertical original
in terms of how we're gonna make it but it's like all the t_v service here that all these years of is here or there
whatever else you programmed into it job just yet separate place or not like all the on button together and you're like i don't even know what i'm turning on the yeah
and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes
yeah
that you wouldn't need to use every day
um
okay so maybe have like one remote that as the main functions on off channel changing volume another right remote with all the special things is that is one thing that on remotes tend to have buttons that the t_v still longer have as well um so like you have to have some workers you don't need a special functions occasionally
um
but
i'm still an wouldn't a normal remote
can the school read
designing a remote control for television remote
good question
and if
the first device is just to be used for the television
would breed them technically be possible to include video recorder function
i don't know they should just stick to
just the control over television
television let the buttons on
it's a good question um
i'll look into it
let me think it's just t_v i mean if it
for yeah
just right that
you practice your television remote control
it's not like it
but then saying
yeah
now i think maybe more advanced matters
so we should
would you should assume or to to
it's just a television remote control
whoa
we'll suppose that would be most of the
play-do record stop buttons or with the do the group as well
i don't know if it works
sort of logical
yes i guess you have to define what
what we're aiming for
if it's just the television and the
it's a bit simpler continuous buttons that would even need to be on it
yeah
estimate the bands being rather poor and
large
if you have older people or people like me that are very coordinated and i
it's really quite important that you're not pressing a small
like teeny mobile phone sized buttons
if we can help it
okay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas man if we move on
can do you
um
now next meeting starts in the minutes
they've actually been only working on this
this week for about twenty
so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um
but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually um the industrial design only men who are doing um
the working design
um
user interface designer that's really interesting
technical functions i guess like keeping in mind the buttons inside the buttons
um user requirements
um
so you'll be hearing about different trends um about different things that people need
um
i guess kind of the same discussion that we've been having moved from the actual concerned consumers
okay um
and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realized in the past and we we didn't have much we just wanted to go brainstorming done um
so
pretty excited to see all your animals
and how old what wonderful um are to sailor
good
oh
any questions
well we're gonna be discussing the next meeting
you know
i haven't gotten an agenda yet um i'll put that together
i'm sure as well each get our own instruction and then um because what we're gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together
not so
sure well have more concrete things to contribute next time
she would be busy
okay um
what about the minutes and probably email by channel audio
oh logistically don't don't
things that we talked about
you email your slides as well
that's
yes i please
i can't
i'll just attach it to you
in your
you're number two and two three
for a corrected
right
put his life on video
yeah
yeah
it
make sure i keep checking the company website emails
the big screen yeah
i just see this oh on you can just save as and save it in my documents
or just fine and easy access
i don't know got you a study
yeah it's a minimum
i see
twenty five percent reasons just for a semester just seem to be even less house
yeah
okay
right
yeah
yeah
um
yeah
okay
right
it's you all again
this is our functional design meeting
ooh
'cause me
right
yeah
okay
we um we put the fashion in electronics
let's start
we had our agenda today um
just to tell you it's true
i see
um
when we do an opening talk about um did you get the minutes i emailed them to you and also putting them them in the shared folder so
yeah just like our objectives and have your three presentations
um i'll talk about the new project requirements i just received
and then we have to make a decision on a remote control functions
i only want to close
we send this meeting at actually twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes so
press what the functional design objectives
um we need to keep in mind the user requirements specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled
the actual functions design what effect the apparatus should have
and the working design
how the apparatus actually works to fulfill its function
back to presentations um
you know what he's going to choose
um
should we go in or you just did it
sure please do
uh huh
alright cool
uh
yeah
'kay t_v
you might have to use the answers
oh
right
i mean
completely just
somehow
uh not a small uh
yeah
oh i see yeah
um
i mean you have to press function
it's actually sunny
comes in the room
um think
is it plugged in the way in your scrutiny
um rates that are not
i think it shows their pushing really hard
and so
oh okay
okay
huh huh
i don't know like
no
in terms of the million dollar
they get
i
so and calculators are able to get access to um the report that it's online or from the only one with this
yeah
right
you know how to clean uh
oh
press the little presentation then
um political why kind of um they have a job
that
yeah right
sources talk alone about
functional requirements uh people specify when the rasta
um i guess real reaction did some market research they had a hundred subjects and their usability lab
and they watched um much t_v and recorded in the frequency that they use particular buttons and the relevant that those buttons had
what they found was they analyze people's desires and needs
oh 'cause and desires
um people specifically said that
if that promotes roughly seventy five percent of the hundred subjects
noted that and that they are more importantly they'll eighty percent of that they would be willing to pay more
for fancier looking remote i don't know anything beyond what fancy means but
that's pretty really used to us i think
um also
it had some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inverse the related to each so younger people were more inclined to uh
want something with voice recognition whereas the older people in uh like sixty and above the segment or so
did that really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition 's
um people also had certain frustrations that i think that we could try to take into consideration
with
our design that being people
um frustrated with losing their remotes
i think over fifty percent of the people mention that that was their biggest frustration
you're also frustrated with the difficulty it is
to learn how to use a remote
and i think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons that just needs to be easy to use
it also mention something called r. s. i. announce hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what our science because i don't them stranger
but
the buttons are still in into uh
there we go well close enough like that so i guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing people do not like that um they're paid to use i guess
'cause a strain
um looking at the need people
specify
power right now is that people's remotes are not matching the operating behavior of people are only
using ten percent of the buttons
that they have offered to them on their remote
and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume people also zap like change the channel
about um sixty five percent
during our views
so we really need to focus in on those volumes
and channel-changer is rather then things like the audio settings and screen settings and channel settings because there is much more infrequently in college complicate
what's going on
so i think that something that you might want to think about
the idea of an l. c. d. screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on
uh people's preferences on that were so i don't know if that's the meeting data as in like that but something for us to consider are also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use
make sure that you know something like
audio settings
is it give it as much importance and visibility on the remote a similar channel changing that's used a lot more often
and basically in order for us to went over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like that it has a fancy appeal and it's not ugly
and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it so do they give them any
hand injuries or
things like that
yeah
thank you very much so it was it was great
um
so move on to the next presentation
um on a fax
yeah
really
i see
yeah that's good
he's eighty
yes right
yeah
um
's
ooh
and i think that's in the shared if i did a great anyone on selected
definitely
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
alright so i'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control
um
need to start by considering what a remote control actually is it's uh
device that allows us to
produce certain effects on the television
so it's basically a communication device we
which are the remote control what we want to do it sends a message to a television site
change channel change volume
uh
yeah i just these settings are just about this
um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control
first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications
we need to know what our final product is gonna be like so we need uh a clever idea of
exactly what this product does
uh how it works uh and what the user is gonna want from this product
um
uh away i'd suggest that we could go about this this by
designing uh somewhat different prototypes of user interface this for this product
um and then
i'm trying to get some feedback
uh 'bout
uh how well these particular prototypes work
uh find out
what people think about
um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience
um
but different different people sort of prefer different things
um we should remember but
remote controls are uh are fairly standard basic requirements when the user is using a remote control
here she expects the buttons to be in certain places so in some sense we're gonna
we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
uh so there we're not completely shocking people
but
i think we'll end up there is also a room for us to introduce novel ideas uh
and just to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different something that stands out
um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities
uh the first of these is this technological thing uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is
the second is is economic uh we need to find a balance between features and vice uh as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add device
yeah uh but it would also include the design of the product yeah
anything
so i had to look on uh on the web uh to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls
in analyzing these we can consider uh
what what things what's good about them uh about things like that by what's bad about them what's wrong with them
um how we can improve on the design as to the diphones and
what can we do to make our product standout flow from the large majority of remote controls
his two examples uh
probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum um
but then after we've got uh
an engineering based design for a remote control so it's one that's got lots of buttons it's it's fully features
everything you might possibly want to do is a you know it's got four backwards up-down channel numbers volume uh freeze frame
yeah it's it's fully features and
yeah it might take a while to get to learn to use it but once you've learned that you speak and you can do whatever you want real t_v
one on the right is a lot more basic it's just got the essential functions of the t_v changing the channel place not volume
it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it but
again
it's it's swings around about the disadvantages you can't use it
say to it
to three's television picture uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control
so we got to
to find out
find a way of striking a balance between the two
um
as i said before remote controls are subjective
different people want all different things
um personally well what i want for my remote control is a device that simple it it's easy to use uh it's got big buttons for doing the things that are most often changing the volume changing the channel
it it does everything that i needed to uh as i said before quite lazy i don't walk across the room just to adjust my television
another one something that that looks cool uh and there sure feels good it's ergonomically designed
okay thank you very much
yes
pretty soon
it's funny to
see then it
drastic difference between those two remotes
yeah
and now that we're very pretty um
i think that could be a selling point
yeah vanishing
yes yeah thanks to certainly market technology that looks cool yeah yeah i guess that's why companies don't happen
no
pretty nice
i i really can't see wanting to sell some
even there it is
oh
sure
already
and so we did a bunch of montana is that just for what you
so uh that was just on the handwritten because they
you know when we grew up to be beautiful
uh really um
no how do i plan to go
um there it's right about wrong
there are three they need if it's with a button
and there are three icons and it's the one that looks like it desk and um
really okay
so this is our working design presentation um i had a bit of some issues with this
because
i wasn't able to find everything i needed but i guess that's they were still in early stages
um
so yeah this is this is the this
the thing about working design is the
what we're trying to do is the working design or is figure out how the operator apparatus can fulfill its function
um
one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee calendar
it works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans
and then you put the beam through a filter
and that filter so
and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of
electrical energy and then other things that are brought in to make it work
i don't know if i'm explaining that very well but i like it because
so the method that it's
um working design as to figure out what you need to make it fulfill this practical function
what what needs to be done and how do we convert all means to make that sound
so
well the easiest thing to do is to break it down
all the points
at which you need something to happen
so you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted
to towards this practical function
then i think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately
so
um
when you press the edge is that
so the findings that i got uh very just very briefly is that
you have a choice
of
the way that the
information is projected to the receiver and
in my opinion infrared is the best way to do that cause you don't need a sideline
so that's one thing i gonna work on
um the user interface is critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happens through the chip
that controls that converts the electrical energy into data
which then goes through the infrared so
there is the chip that uh i think ian is designing it's gonna be
crucial
and it really it all comes down to that to the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design
so the components that we find here are the energy source you know the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip
which converts the data the user that's controlling the chip and and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
yeah for main components
and
they
are designed to sort of like this you have your energy source right there
which
'kay and
um
brings
energy or information to the chip
which
is also controlled by the user so you have to
energy going to the user who's controlling the chip will
not what i understood
uh
uh huh
um you use that thing on that you can go
yeah
previous previous
sorry about that
pardon
oh
no no no no
okay okay let's just get back to my schematic here
double
the right with the left hand would yeah
i think it's a person
here
too much and you know
if you do
yeah where are you sorry
guys i'm kind of pathetic things like this
um
right
so you have your energy source your user interface is controlling the chip
the chip also uses the energy
and the chip
through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infrared bulb
which will then bring the data to the receiver
so hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of cardboard way
this is the
the parts of the working design that need to be figured out
and
personal preferences besides the fact that i can't spell we need a long lasting energy source people don't want to be changing it a lot
we need a chip
that works well with the user interface that isn't too complicated
yeah straightforward interface like the enlist saying simple not
overloading it with
information and we need a reliable and clear infrared signal
so that you're not leaving your remote rather than having to get frustrated and go do it by hand
that's pretty much it for the working design
yeah mixed groups
and just
okay
just
he he yes absolutely
oh
yeah
yeah
right
a give a total do we two threes yeah
my d_v_ds you're ready to be ready
yeah
i don't know
exactly
left to receive regular t_v
right
not looking good for this
yeah
um
for about every time
yeah
yeah it is a good deal
oh
oh
okay
moving nothing on my screen
do you
well you see yeah that's
okay requirements we have a couple new requirements i was just emailed right before the meeting and then we have to keep in in um in minors or craziness
we bring it up get around all the meetings are far but
we're not gonna work with teletext because um
we did that's been taken everybody interest we're not gonna worry about um
not to worry about that month's top spots
um
it's a british thing
oh you don't notice it no no you can do which can explain it
oh
you know it's like uh
span is kind of similar to very very basic web phones and um
you know
mike you have uh numbers in your remote control
um already
and you typed in the page number you want
so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of
index pens
on the television screen just in some text and some very broke it can graphics on there
when you just type numbers to go to different pages and pitch information um mostly rather boring stuff like what's on t_v next and
prices
lottery numbers and sports scores you know
useful but if you see the t_v saying like go to page one sixty on c. fax now that's what they're talking about
so it's pretty old technology so
he wanted to practice one form i have no idea why we don't have
oh okay good
you know so
okay um well we're not gonna
them and decided we're not gonna work with that
um
okay um and we also get the like your question earlier on whether it is going to be to for television media et cetera just for television
that are tax time
um otherwise it tends to complex or wanna get this out um very quickly
we only have a
short amount of time
um and finally had this one marketing i think um our corporate image has to be recognizable
so while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our color and our slogan in the in the new design
so what's our corporate image like is this kind of yellow color which huh
quickly put functional emailing asking we have that the emphasis on the art is in switchboard and wall
you
but it's here with like the
um
fasciae
electronics i can keep that in that in mind
so we want something that looks good
yeah
yeah and it's yellow
yeah or it had that maybe some buttons could be yellow like we can we can play around with a little bit
um
okay we need to talk about our functions and our target group
we decide who our target group is your um your analysis of different market um of the marketing you identified that different groups one in different things or had certain preferences for example that um
that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition the younger people did
um
and so
who are we in this at
if we're gonna uh say that function uh fashion we put the fashion in electronics then you
automatically i think
the younger group
that that's who's gonna be attracted to this
yeah so the thing was that i have the money to buy it
that's
you know
it's gonna be twenty five euro remember so um
it has to be all marketable to um
whoever it is
hm
is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes up with a television because that would affect the way that we market
well right now what we're doing is um deciding on
just the remote itself
so it will probably be sold separately
but 'kay twenty five
you're by itself
the only breeds on that i was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump
after thirty five people don't really care as well so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five there
yeah i think that that's a good idea i dunno maybe given any other numbers working um in terms of each later but
if that's sort of the only quality that we have but
it's divided into age and we would wanna stick between fifty and thirty five range
that's probably uh the population quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway so
yeah it might be a fairly good target group for us
no those are that's old specific for speech recognition are we gonna use that as one of our functions
um
um
i i would say no because it's gonna work too much the price
especially if we are marketing it as a selling product people are gonna be paying
uh
but god we've got a price limit of
the twelve twelve and half euros interpretive situated easiest and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into button you twelve and a half euros without having to make too many other compromises
what also we gonna put i mean not that i'm really going how about it i don't know what else you can
put a remote to make it technologically advanced um so like other than just me yeah look out how is it i mean it can you look really great and some of the thing up and um buttons um i don't mean gonna buy a new remote
well why are we
why are we aiming for technological advancement everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean um
more technology like they could use in mind you could
i mean
not
if
they might be overwhelmed with
with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
someone's looking to buy a new remote don't they want like an upgrade and um now
upgraded a well we can look for look and look at upgrade or we can locate um user-friendly
yeah simplification
they could have across the remote taking with their t_v that's just
in house bunnies
or maybe a para choir maybe they're just missing it
um
and we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have
the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or or you might do it i think it's a complicated uh
we should semantics there like if there's just a simple either that's where this way that have like the mean months and then you can pull something out kind of it might be that the rest of the buttons but there are something like when
did you say the word global controls look
like some t_vs they have a sort of
uh sliding screen on the remote control but no it's overcomplicate buttons oh so if you wanna do something complicated for
program your television or which units don't you
you open up this little or show slow speed on those who spectral buttons and like people who don't wanna ever look at that and never even have to speak um and if you get the instruction manual icons of the and you just don't even reading on never even know that those things can pull out you know you're happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes one as the easy ones among us
nobody wants it all still on monday
um we have to be careful that that that does in p. d. um the chip transmitting information
yeah
but um that's gonna be
mostly technologically
um
okay um so what what are we emphasizing
right well in this city
simplicity and functions and simplicity and fashion
okay those are very good goals i think um that we need to keep in mind it with everything we do
simplicity and fashion and
or usability explicit
um
how do you wanna say that which includes um an emphasis on making the infrared very functional yes but you don't have to travel around a lot
yeah
what can you do there
make the infrared more function like why would it not be
or something i think it's a lot to do with battery
but that's just mind the battery and that i think that the chip
takes the data and presents it while without sort of scattering
yeah
so just the quality of the job
yeah
i think so
um
the quality of the quality of all the components really i mean
we can't really do anything
shiny work 'cause
can be visible down the line
so our target group
we're saying fifteen or thirty five
well i don't know when you split numbers if we're not doing this
voice recognition yeah which i kind of i kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control um uh like it might be necessary for t_v enough for the kids doesn't believe it's pretty hard to
yeah yeah and it might be too expensive
i the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you low weight like you needed like you would need or you just talk to to
yeah probably
ultimately lazy people
no going to do what we can do remote
yeah
yeah
maybe i mean if i get more numbers i'll email you before the next meeting in terms of each of those
but this doesn't divide up anything there was only a hundred subjects also too which is um
i mean
really is not representative especially if that's hundreds up to date and can subdivide into each group that means that very few in each each group so
yeah not the
i think regardless where you're aiming for that under sixty five or something
under sixty five okay that's a good start
um
i see where it um i can we narrowed it down to maybe a um
teenagers and families
'cause that would go on to like fifty nationals or something
do you like fifty uh
oh
it's it's hard to see bananarama figure out right now
i think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of really easy i mean we we said simplicity is is one of the features so it's going to
appeal to people
maybe people have problems with technology you know people will get scared by having lots of buttons and i might be older people
but then we've also got fashion which is something that definitely appeals to younger people
i mean we don't about define a target group by the demographic or be in we define it by like the demographic of
like conduct how much money they have to spend or something like that basically what is the has these available in the television
to like always have a bottle like that type of thing
um
so maybe it's more useful to just to just find objectives like fashion isn't lots and even define specific
target group
as far as ages
because yeah things will different will appeal to different people
okay
um well there are couple functions
do we want something that do we want
some kind of a thing to find it if it's lost
um yeah like a button on the t_v you can press another right or something i don't know like a beep
i mean i guess over four fifty percent um of the fact that first recently to have that was the biggest one and
people so that that happened to me i mentioned it before we knew about it
and if we're talking about making me easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing uh
sort of a then would be relevant like the overall calling back yes no
pretty good
okay we have to uh we have about four minutes left to define our functions so let's do that quickly
and so we want something to keep from getting lost
yeah
and
wind
um
we want large buttons for the essential things
yeah
yeah large accessible buttons for the essentials
we want a possibility to um to get
um
possibility to get out uh extra functions
hm
yeah
which are kind of hidden away in some way
well no he didn't but uh
but not as prominent as the main features
um
um yeah
anyway
and we also will
we want it to be fashionable
which i'm not sure if that's a function so much as a
uh huh
yeah
so anything on the coffee table it's not like and i saw that movie
yeah
okay do it any other subtle functions that we need
battery
do we need a long life battery place
yeah but i mean that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really
well that means never have achieved power yeah
we should maybe investigate priorities about
true too
i suspect that
were controlled by the book
yeah i would imagine it just 'cause it is an electronic device that um it
i think it does i don't i don't think about weight operated chip and convert that much data with though
the one problem but you got maybe have a little tracking station like a mobile phone
really cool cradle for your ipod
yeah those was possible
we could maybe do that instead
so you don't you're a like a rechargeable battery
but no that might contribute to less people losing it to have to do that
stays at one place
um
yeah to think about um space in the rooms to like
yeah 'cause them i mean would you put on the t_v or not
steak okay that's a that's a good idea and keep it
yeah that's a self phenomenon
with the phone
okay
um
yeah we're gonna conclude now what does everyone said
the functions um 'kay
um after the meeting we're gonna key to complete disks um questions summarize the summary
you know the word summarization
um and they'll have a lunch break
after that we have thirty minutes of individual work
um a major problem minutes in the project documentation is included as powerpoint slides everyone can do that as well but the great
um each individual actions i mean
um
i mean the industrial design eva components concept
user interface the user interface concept
my big trend were watching
and as
as per last time you get specific you had instructions from your personal coach emailed to you
and hopefully help next so you'll be able to access more of the website but they seem to tell you that you could
yeah it's been frustrating but
um
you sort of know any frustrations or any um
it's just like half a year um
emu or
um
'cause summaries
okay
sounds good
tree-view
and you got to
'kay
did you um we will have like four years in our group for
yes i just did that
hopefully it is better to people
yep
yeah
looks like there are um
looks like the second one with mine
i consider that i do it from like an earlier project i think so
okay
um
whereas 'bout
your names under the shared folder under it might not even be new so in there we have a technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements
always
yeah i only have three i just have a card for yeah
yeah that's why i have this one of those so
you don't have my
no but that's good i think you're cindy now
separately that's uh server
's
just yeah
um
but development and then say the
probably their
arena and you can't sit there
okay
well i'll figure that out in the meantime
okay ah
okay
um
yes
yeah you got actually small dimensions
i'm gonna try this also
takes a while i guess
i just
'cause
screen
if you need a function f. eight again it's it has the same cost so
first time we had it
does this second have you again
it'll turn it off and here
computer
and i know there you hear news can be fine
if you do it again
yeah go back to just being on your computer
and then other times and you'll get both so if you can't
if you get an entire disk exactly
i guess
yeah
yeah
yeah
fourteen months
that leads to you know how we can um
so conceptual design meeting
uh and it started approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again
um so we'll go just after three o'clock
um
okay
our agenda we're gonna do it opening a minute review the minutes of the last meeting then we'll have a three presentations
um and then we have to make a decision on the remote control concepts
by a close
opening
are these are a minutes from the functional design
we side our target group is that hackers on who can afford it because we have international appeal um said bits for all age groups of different um functions of that
i mean objectives for simplicity and fashion
and um in specific functions or something to keep the remote from getting lost
large buttons for the essential functions
a possibility for extra functions like a sliding
deciding peace
and a long light battery or a charging station
okay now three presentations i'd like to do it in this order first do the conceptual specification of components properties and materials
could be
um and the conceptual specification of user interface
and then the trend watching
alright
oh
hm
function f. eight it
okay
right
oh
i'm i'm very excited by
this one actually guys i uh had a lot of fun
doing the old components design
this is where your cat
what does it take to make a remote control and what should be make our specific remote control about uh
um
so we need to examine each element separately that we're designing a full thing so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole
the main elements of remote controls in general and therefore as as well are the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip
and the battery
these are all things that we had sort of addressed before but
yeah we take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made and what they should look like
the case uh the options that i've gotten from headquarters about what we can do um there's there's a shape
or the case we could do a flash a flat case the curved case or maybe even a double double curved case
haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet just keep that in mind that these are the options that we have for manufacturing
and we can make a case out of
plastic then the main base would be plastic but we have all these sort of fashion
in technological elements we can handle the word latex titanium rubber or other color just types of plastic
that would be our case
um buttons for buttons we have um
push-buttons which is what
real reaction uses the most often but we also have scroll scroll wheels which can have integrated push buttons for we could go all high-tech and have an l. l. c. d. screen
um circuit board in chip we could have the simple one regular one or an advanced one depending on what our other needs are
and then the battery i think is where things get most exciting we're talking about long life batteries here in here we can have you sort of basic double a batteries but we also have these options of um
using the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watchers where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up
um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery
or solar battery although there are slight
um
complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case
if we have a solar battery
or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in the
torches from about fifty years ago flashlights
not quite sure what that is but that's a description that i receive so that's what i passing on to you
so those are options
um
personal preferences that i was thinking
true
here's what
we've been talking about all through fashion and simplicity
so if we're going for fashion in our cases i think that what we're gonna wanna look at is
a curved or a double curved case
probably with a variety of design elements maybe titanium maybe somewhat we're gonna have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual materials
that's sort of what i have in mind and we wanna go for simplicity
probably push-buttons but i'm sort of intrigued by the idea of the scroll
scroll wheel if anyone has anything
any ideas on that i mean i know the ipods and things right now have touch scroll
um
buttons which are exactly like what they're describing so that might be something we wanna look into
and i'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery
solar i don't think would be such a good idea because how often
are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light
but this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and a simple machine around will make it work
i think that that would be a very interesting thing
but
i think we also wanna go for a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down um we really only need a regular advanced chip if we're gonna start using an l. c. d.
so i think we want
to be aware of not making things over really
technological if they don't need to because that'll keep our manufacturing price way down
that's what i have for options um i appreciate anyone's input that that's what i'm seeing for the future of the
the look of this thing
it's double curved like would that be like to him kind of thing
i'm not sure i haven't received any specific
visuals imagine like
double curved is like
you know like two so
curses and i'm sort of over just be like
a single word polish kind yeah i'm not i'm not sure but i'll let you know as soon as i get any pictures
um
yeah would you
i know if we do have a double curved case it can't have any titanium in it
but the titanium they are quite their marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space program
so that could be quite interesting space age mode
yeah
it's just all things so you just read marketing into the element
that's that's all i have to do that's
i hope i didn't go through that too quickly
i'm just a broker question um
the weight of these phone elements
and you know i i did a no idea
um
i'm assuming
that 's
a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight you and that add to titanium is very like i know who but it is uses that's really basic
me
that's all i have gotten so far to
oh
any other questions
i think so yeah
we can say this in the uh shared projects if anyone wants to look at the thing that has considerable notes on the topic as well if anyone needs any more information
oh
um if you do it yourself you can put those on or um
into him either
just oh i knew both in a way but if anyone has a specific questions don't hesitate to email me or something
right
because like
you know we're um concepts concepts of user interface
hm
hasn't seen so much time in the in the
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
right
right
i just
yeah
yeah so i'm gonna there's gonna be
the concept of the user interface this to this device
um we've talked about this uh
the two essential properties of the user interface we want it to be simple
and we want it to be fashionable
um
uh huh
we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves useful purpose uh remote people to be able to use it as a remote control
so we need to determine what the essential functions are but
of the device uh and make sure but
which includes
so we've included all the various things that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people
we have a number of different choices for a design construct
um and start start something that there are actually some examples of
um
but
essentially we need to choose
how how is this device going to work how how
what kind of model this are going to be for user interaction with this device
uh once we've chosen the uh uh concept for it's we can um
designer features and the concepts making sure that we get
all the essential functions in the device and
uh the extra function is uh the more advanced features
and of course we also have to make it look cool
so basically that's what we don't want
we don't want lots of buttons or complicated features we want something that looks nice and simple
is a a fairly simple device this is anything like point for apple um
i think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons it's very minimalist it can its design
uh he uses four buttons to
to move around a bunch of settings on the small l. c. d. screen
um
the figure i like about this is it
it's very very quick
to access the main features i can just about make up
uh for us the bottom three buttons are uh
uh previous track next track to play polls
but the main
the main features of like what the things you use all over time
um
but if you want to do anything more advanced you don't have a little menu on the l. c. d. screen and use the buttons just to scroll around and find more advanced which is what
so i think that's not too good
a good kind of model that we could have
um
here's a another example this is uh
it's an interesting idea and 's i think it it looks pretty cool
um it's certainly gotten a multi value
uh it's nice and colorful it's nice and bites
uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around the buttons are a different shapes and then you can sort of
yeah if you're watching t_v in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons which
and basically yeah it's it's it's fun
so i i like i like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often
so it needs to
a few buttons to select your favorite channels i mean most people when they watch t_v
if i have two hundred and fifty channels on the t_v and i watch it
for for the west
so you know buttons for your favorite channel changing the volume which is something you do over time when you're watching t_v
and the button to switch off because you get bored
um other features things like adjusting the brightness tune in the t_v
uh
i don't know how else you do have a t_v
um
but these are
these are all necessary functions uh you can't have it
there's no point having a television but you can't you know you can't see the contrast
so we need to find a way of including these somehow
um the uh one of the suggestions of make is to him
is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
so we would even have a small l. c. d. display on the device itself
or uh have a just a menu display that comes up on your television set can be controlled through the device under the light to access access the advanced features
uh it was keeping a very small and simple set of buttons
for all the features that you use most often
okay so you'd be advocating an l. c. d. then
i don't
that's one way to go yes
yeah i mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you
if you have an l. c. d. display it's it's nice because it's
it lets you just sit down and then control your television for your lunch or anything
there are disadvantages and and l. c. d. display would have to be quite yeah 'cause with it
right with
just
well we'd i assume we're gonna be making quite a device
um
it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting is it because it depends watch t_v in the dark yeah you need to be able to see how the the l. c. d. display
the alternative is to have a
no screen display on your television but you control any control
a bit like a bit like a they have these um digital boxes where you you press buttons and it comes up with your
this thing of or short words on each channel i mean not that's also a good idea
it can it does have its problems as well if you've got a small t. v. and you're sitting on the other side we started with the teletext comes out
hm
uh but that's a that's a design
decision that we can make
i do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing and then you can see what's going on
um
and so
like favorite channels is is applicable but i think that you do need to have some kind of function work
it's
um you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description of it i don't like i know i using it as a performer he was saying well if it if it was a lot else d. on the on the remote i don't know that you could think that you'd be able to see it i think we're talking menu
like
contrast and color tuning the p. c. or something if i understood you
yeah there are the double enhancement sources
okay
but it is just some experiment mind is that if we put a display on the remote control
good uh communication is one way so
you can't have a television send information back to work and to look at least i don't think you can
yeah
yeah
oh okay
no language market
okay
yeah
oh
okay okay
um h. o. o.
function mark
oh yeah
ooh
right
whatever
you cross five eight
just in passing more time
uh-huh
well then all of this can be
anything so
i think
um this is number two
oh really
okay
yeah
okay so we're gonna look a little bit trend watching
is the u_s getting um an executive summary that was
uh mark investigation and remote controls that was recently connected
and then also some fashion-watchers in paris and milan you could comments on some things that are gonna be going on this year
so first um they have people be trained on the important aspects of the uh remote controls
and right now they're saying that currently there is a functional look-and-feel
i have friends but that believe over the next year it's that's gonna be switching to uh
fancy look-and-feel remote so that just goes back to
the whole desire uh for our real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and
so even though we're stressing more talking the moment talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea uh
they're sort of why has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look-and-feel and as these are brains
the top one is double important to the second one which is doubly important to the third one so
just to take that weight into account
and the second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovation that would be like if we use something like this these material uh
l. c. d. screen things like that and then easy to use was the third most important but so
really matter what we need to fill this the most some fancy look-and-feel according to the u_s
i'm sure getting
yeah and
actually march
talks about that this year's type trend for clothes shoes are pretty cheap
it is it's
yeah
that there's a preference very so why do you
type material oh
and so that brings us to my for the fact it is
who wants a spongy remote for what you are not sure about
yeah
i think that i
one thing that's gonna go on
at work goes stale they just use the phone
um in the year so
even though this is coming from as a as you know trendwatch market research
i don't know how much have we left there really
wanna take away also considering that the research has been carried out by real reaction i'm a little
hesitant as to uh
like
how these questions may have been worded if necessarily peaceful fashion into technology even if ease of use is necessarily the right drinking
personally like i might reverse it but
if we're working for this company i guess no matter what we have to stress fashion the most
is necessary he's made spongy material
yeah there there's all kinds of school for education in that window
yeah
have a lot of notes to share if you want then that pretty much some of the of
so we have
he really
so the questions were there
yeah uh what can i
possibly mowing them
um did you have any ideas had said
possibly use these
um at how to use a fruit vegetable around
or the spongy material at all
okay
could we make is like could we make a spongy remote it would be easier titanium tasks
if it's latex see it's kind of
and then it going to have to find a way to protect like the chip and alarm
in in
i my understanding of the latex cases that it's in fact hard to protect
step inside but it's not covered with the latex which is spongy and softer on your hands
it's there's something to be said i mean we we got that
i mean earlier from you about um not wanting it to
ah ah repetitive stress injury to um things in in
yeah yeah so something instead of it'll be yeah great and then you want a great memory then like easy sinking into this yet i think and envisioning more like yeah
you know the material that you had when you said that like a bicycle really doesn't hurt
yeah you have one hundred i'm imagining that sort of thing and i but uh i think it's gone
given the list of materials uh this for it it it that seems doable
could we go into fruit and vegetable colors you could color kurdish or maybe like
um
couple main ones being like on the lines are striving
right
the the buttons could be pretty easy that way
is this supposed to be shift work approach
oh
i don't like it or carrots or something
workspace period shays link here and there
really the buttons could be set large button that's so that's the yeah
what is it like a round remote instead of like convertible up and down on like problems but it's right
offensive
she's a group
yeah
yeah
it it will i think you'll be able to hold it cause i think the reason they won't are uh
but but um
i think
because it depends when you when you use a remote
you press the buttons with your combination
yeah moving to um
i usually order money and maybe
or maybe you want something that shaped like a mobile phone or
so you you ordering once you press about the buttons actually very so i tended to
yeah just just um sometimes i'm
but i mean in order to get to all of them you know yeah they have to be within a certain message usually don't work
four five buttons anyway um it's it's not this much
it when i'm when i'm pressing buttons i'm out like that so i do it hold it in
yes that's really hard in one hand yeah and you press
you press the buttons yeah and we can use
my thought remote wonder figure on the touch of the
right well the i hope uh
we are like i um
is the the button on an ipod is it what is it is it just four buttons or is it implied
well there's one available here
with i mean each version of it has been a little bit different
the one i have doesn't have
there for a new like uh yeah you have a lot of the in between lines when they were doing that anymore
when you press the center button that's that there won't be so much memory
oh okay this one is going to that's not right
yeah
i think might be good for us as 'cause like you could have the same we'll sort of affect her
like
channel flipping and then the other line could be like for volume like just the idea of like both
so few buttons for main things but then hynek go back mateo
and like
i don't know if we would want it on the screen there
on the actual t_v i kind of am wanting to say on the t_v because
for changing the brightness so much when i see it happening i do
and
and it still has a real screen might be
good in
theory but not as used when we do this in practice
yeah also yeah cause you would be looking down at the other cities like up a t_v and then people don't wanna do that
okay um
we have about fifteen minutes left so i'm i'm in a
continue with my present presentation um and one more slide before we close but in that site is when we need to make decisions buttons these kinds of things so i'll just bring up
it
sure you'll
well we we
um
with any more information on fruits and vegetables
not much
yeah
changeable covers like for your mobile
in different fruit vegetable colors yeah
yeah
you can split yeah and then they take the covers could be spongy latex
whereas but the actual model could be titanium if you could
cause they live here
perhaps a problem affected um
there's a reason
the the packaging
it should be like a lemon i mean the the packaging is like the people
so instead of opening the box you just kind of feel a remote control
i'm a little little booklet like that i can do this
i think was so over top
phone
the way it all comes out
um
oh it's
okay um components concept
energy
sure oh really oh yes
right i'd sort of skip over that hoping it wouldn't get
be necessary but
um this is that this is the agenda they gave me sorry just a little over
decisions like the
okay is it
this isn't allowed to carry on
that's based on the battery you uh
what do people do
yes
kinetic battery i guess i think it's a toss that maybe it's really cool
yeah
yeah i mean
okay
totally take a problem about wanting to change that it's
yeah
no i think it's good is as long as we consider the the cost and uh
how reliable it is
programs having gotten a nice group
cost yeah any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery
but
um
but over time but if we're using any
the cheaper chip they are leaving out i think
um circuit boards
yeah um yeah i do bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced there there's been fiberglass with copper wires attached onto them
and i think they're quite easily printed on by a machine which chip-on-print is when the machine prints on the wires and solder it all together for us
i don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions i wasn't really given any options i was just given that this is how they're done
okay
um
yeah i can't i can't really tell you i can i can tell you a lot about how it works
but i don't know any decisions um
if they're if they're really optional
and say looking for circuit boards and productions and
his family
understand
um okay there will move on to the case
um oh but i guess maybe if we decide on like a simple a regular advanced chip okay here's the here's the thing on the chips and uh
that i got um
simple regular advanced chip-on-print that chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor so we don't have to worry about that
um
'kay the push-button
if we're gonna have push-buttons they require a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and an l. c. d. requires advanced
do we wanna scroll wheel or do we just want push buttons
um
i don't think we need really need disk
it will i mean it might be nice for changing the volume
it'll be nice for changing the volume but i don't know how useful would be for changing the channel because you don't have control over numbers are you you really need buttons is neutral
it be handy for going through it
if there was an on a menu of your channel choices
when you can scroll you could scroll through the channels
and then the volume which is like minutes left for the meeting and the volume and just be like the same way
yeah foreign backgrounds
i'm just thinking like it would make it much like speaker
sort of looking
yeah
and otherwise no matter how many buttons we have are gonna have like you know black with red sitting down there no it's gonna never really sort of start looking like
you know it's gonna sound like we want something uh stacked up
um
so
have a scroll for volume
or for all the secret functions
when you get on the on screen menu of all your functions like your remote
could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus
i think you know i think the scroll wheel would be nice but it's not necessary
right
so we could either go with a simple a regular chip depending now maybe we could table others um for later
uh huh
i think well i think when we're going to be the user phase we're gonna have to decide the interface we have to decide um
whether i have a school or not well let's think about that well we talk about case against a case i i'm kinda like in the idea of latex
if if spongy is that in the room
i'm a little um i'm more hesitant about it because i'm worried about protecting stuff on the inside
okay
um could be hard and then attacker everything that i would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone whatever kind of thing that i've seen
just not related to this but i've latex cases before is that
there's like a hard plastic
inside and just cover it with the latex okay not to speculate on windows just enough to be crippled
like by candles or or anything that you've seen like that
the inside is hard
i don't think we need to worry about
projecting the circuit board i think that that's time for us okay
so we it we do want latex
yeah
okay
takes uh ooh
probably in colors maybe fruity vegetable colors
yeah
pretty hillary's
okay um let's go do you have a user interface then then after that
chavez's
oh and we want a curved case yeah
or double curved
well we don't really with the differences right i'm thinking curtis i'm sorry yeah
yeah yeah okay
we don't really know what the difference
um
okay interface the type and the supplements
so
pushable or scroll
right
you know
um
and i think if we wanna keep our costs um we should just go to four push-buttons
because then we can have uh a simple chip
uh it's
it's simpler it's it's cheaper to make push-buttons and that is the school doesn't get us in terms of the
in terms of
economics it's probably better to
and if we had a screen on screen um
kind of thing that you could scroll through like you can use the buttons to scroll through the ears
you know it's
i think it is fairly simple
for channel surfing i think the scroll an actual like an ipod kind of scroll thing would be too fast
yeah
i see
push-buttons at least unless we get any information i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is then
a push button but it's gotta be some more expensive so
no i think it might be better to
put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery in the cool case too
yeah
is it is it is you do you feel yeah and let's like saving anything else i mean i'm not
records all on the scroll wheel it's more just to give it a different kind of look what is it gonna be a latex
pick thing that's gonna look cool um
that's quite a bigger impact on the scroll wheel
yeah
okay so we're gonna go with um
type
push-buttons
yeah
and then supplements how are we gonna do that
oh what you mean by supplements
um
i assume that's what else we're gonna like have the um like the additional buttons we can use
um so we have like a menu button
used to that we can access on sweet things
you know
then okay um so we're doing it on screen menu so they don't score or buttons gonna be hard enough
on-off uh volume
favorite channels
oh so like when you're wherever you go
you may you tape stars that are you know you're already present
um
research channels
and then we're gonna need um numbers
one two zero
oh we wouldn't even the numbers
i think maybe numbers seems to this kind of old energy he said it
check i guess you can just hold it down
yeah when you know you can just do the scrolling i need some kind of
i don't know so up-down kind of button yeah volume control type of remote
for example
yeah
okay now i'm on finishing the meeting now um i'd actually exactly thirty minutes um you need to have things to do look-and-feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modeling clay
yeah yeah
so is this which i mean
you know basically um do we said on the chip let's go with a simple just able to yeah
yeah and and it'll take you everywhere
uh i think these are in our shared folder okay cool
heh
for a kid
i wasn't expecting that
good
oh okay
yeah
right
okay
oh
oh
um
okay
okay
okay um
welcome to our detailed design meeting
in pretty
he started
yeah
approximately fifty forty or something
okay
okay
uh the agenda that we're gonna do lip opening and then
um i'll
ten minutes from last meeting what we did just fast
um
then we'll have the prototype presentation in a look at the evaluation criteria
well the finances
and finally i do production evaluation and close
so starting off with um last
the last one i don't have here
um but we talked about energy we're gonna use a kinetic battery
um we want to use a simple chip because we're not gonna need a shuffle um
you can either scroll
um which is in a latex case
with fruity colors it's curved
and
um we're using push-buttons
and with this not much of an on screen menu
so it sounded like we had said um
like eight or nine buttons
including five percent changes
okay
let's do the look-and-feel design presentation first
but
you want to
right well we have a three different prototypes and i guess we'll start with with this one um
we have our colors not
are not fixed that this is the general shape
um it's you
sort of
yeah like
this you can't already switch it over and then
it's easily adaptable to either hand
you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push them with your
index finger for other hand or even i mean there's a whole variety another like this impressive with your same index finger
uh we have the on-off button at the chip it's very visible very big
we have ah
up and down buttons which are also gonna be a channel selectors and we have a little menu button here
if you push
if we're just pushing is normally the the menu buttons if the the volume buttons rather if you press select once they become channel changing buttons
if we pressed select three times in the menu with the other features
and part possibly also with your
t_v channel choices shows up and you have your five free sets down here
and people want
have hold of that see how it feels in your head
that's our number one prototype
um
you wanna
present the material or shall we go margin using the little labels and it'll take a bit
you go about one in columbus uh
the
yeah most parameters on this one is known as the potato
uh it's
uh huh
how can i present it
it's an ergonomic shape
so it fits in your hand nicely um
its designs to be used even in your lifetime or or in your right hand
um i've gone ahead just uh just before buttons on this one
um
to glue buttons here are for adjusting the volume second volume up
uh volume down on the other side yeah
um the ones out for it
oh changing
channels
channel up and channel down and that's um in-between
your favorite channels that you've selected
uh this middle button yeah things up on screen menu
and money working on the screen menu
use the other four buttons to navigate to a menu system
and the middle bottom uh disliked
uh it's
that's basically what i was to try to
um on off
uh that would be one of your channels basically satellite channels there would be
just a sheep station machine off yeah
good the middle button on the on screen menu function of the power button
um
but
no really it would make it hard to turn the machine off
to turn your t_v off
if you press in hell that may be
you know you don't want to carry on well enough
so possibility into
and then finally we have
um the martian or the parent
either way um it's a bit different
just
a little bit more of a creative field
i have the on-off
talk 'll stamina
on the top
oh
we have the five p. set
see
right
yeah they have all the sides to make it a little bit more three dimensional you have your channel changing volume changing buttons on your menu button right here in the middle
so
that's for your consideration as well as plus is interesting talking wait to have standing up we figured it could stand up like this on your table if you wanted to if i read about the bottom five
so i don't have the middle right uh the menu select button
very interesting this this is a favorite sort of software prototypes oh
basically in terms of making decisions what we need to do is
first of all decide on the form uh which are three different shapes the remotes then
decide what kind of button do we want how many buttons and then to choose what colors we want to make the buttons and if we want to put any text on the device like labels on the buttons or
broadband labeling
oh
and i go and whatever
we were we were thinking that
normally we go for fruity colors but maybe
we're also thinking that you should have
middle aged
man
for an example customer might not want a fruity colored remote some
maybe
we have one version that's a bit tone down
maybe with with less contrast on it
there's something still a little bright to make it hard to lose but
but we don't want it to look like a good story
yeah so that was one thing that we brought up over email i don't know if you picked up your email with the um the uh on feature that we considered for not getting lost right well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email
and
we think that each of these are so distinctive
that it's not just like another piece of technology around your house it's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen you know so we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be
a script without composite and extraction since then
you know
would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like i don't you
take to your
to your t_v on that when you press it a little like b. goes off
that would be
conceptually possible
i think it would be difficult technologically because if you own if you remotes lost
it's probably on diversity
and in that case you can't be shown send an interesting signal to that
well you know he's so it's
i'm not quite sure that's why we have i wonder if it's
if it's more just a gimmick than anything else
probably not
how many times do you really
seriously lose your remote control what would
what a device like that actually help you to find
there might be something that you can do in the circuit board in the chip
to make it make a noise or something but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon
okay
that's on their evaluation
do
um recently that we decided not to worry about that for now
because most lines are very bright so you're right they're gonna stick out
uh you said do people have a preference as far as feel in functionality
yeah i 'cause those
simple words are sort of already there so we're trying to think of something
sort of like new one fine you know this is like
well your initial initially trying to do just that it's like comparable and like not different
i sort of like this one like i don't know why it just it's like small but still all
sort of like you looking at now
but i also like the the side buttons on our own like i think that's kind of key
but
and how much any 'cause has to do with it
the fashion i'm bob
sort of cool looking
thing that we also need to focus on
could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on oath
so then we'll we'll oh oh that's good
the
yeah
sticker
that's a good job
um and why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria at most money like i think we're supposed to have one that we do it for oh okay
okay i was so small they examples to develop i mean i have to like writes on the whiteboard so
i guess are just right on right now i actually don't have like uh
halfway down to my cats
it could be tough
yeah
it's kind of like a joystick or anything
that's not cool and they
maybe a little smaller than i know i get both customers
basically for two years
no it doesn't kind of like look at the phone
fruits
true
k_f_c for uh
i could have standpoint i could do kind of like the standard like
yeah
i don't sell to give keep a grip to
cause it goes in between anger and um
just things like this one
okay it's everybody learning then there's detail
i like the idea of the arguments too i mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down
that one who
i am worried about like um using the menu
um
in uh d_c
like in within menus their sub menus and so how do you get back to the main menu
well that's on the ipod for example you just every time you wanna go back you get the menu button again it brings you back one level
but that has a menu button separate from the select button whereas if this one's about the menu and the select button
this is disk in the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for the structure
that's right
define the choice that you want so you press the uh you press the right button
uh
could these are used for going to answer the just we're going into multiple software is maybe it could be one of those if you pressed on hold
for two seconds and then it brings you back one level or something you
okay well as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it so
yeah
okay so which one we sort of roughly let me actually draft
whether or not it
these are 's
um necessities
but yellow in one thought
they take up a mailing list at the time so
okay well we doesn't change it after we go through this one so basically we video
'cause and then things that we talked about
for me to make sure that remote actually guys
conform to the things that is that is going to help so always we're gonna do is we each need to separately
right each of the final thing that our target average just to make sure
she doesn't need that also
past time
just go around
the ontology are still one sided with
one me really strange though
and then we can
not through at all or fall off
if the remote that we created
can porous it by criteria so we can do this one first
first you wanna know it needs uh the end of the look-and-feel
um object yeah
so i can i can hang up
for japanese
yeah well i was probably somewhere else i mean with a like a
right
that's just fine
yeah
oh with that
you should go
i i kind of think it's it's you could have that i'd give it a one or so
no matter what give you a dollar there
i would give it
a one
um crafted it's creative i don't know if fancy is the word that we use
i don't know any of them are and so
in
i'd say
to because they're unique
i'd have to
so
what's that
alright i seems our scale for functionality is functional
i don't think it's true much longer to one
one
i think it is
it's functional it's also pretty basic so there are two
right
um
functional
i think it'll get everything done i think it might be a little confusing
first
um
well there's no that's that's gonna be a later one that okay then i may give it a to
oh
um i don't see this technologically data
did you functional
yeah she's not
um is it technologically innovative yet
ooh
not really i mean
that so much we don't have any screen we don't have
yeah they chat
other than what it looks like i don't know if it's
well the kinetic battery the battery
it's it's added that one cell
oh you wouldn't notice
but it but it's definitely here it will be like a i have never change the batteries may have like latex them against the wall obviously material
is it includes a lot of features that are made it really
yeah
uh i won't say that
it's
yeah
like fancy versus creative it's it's
different
design innovative i dunno
i'll give it a three
oh
oh
so it's technologically it's not
it's not unique i mean this is just
is it is it just push-buttons um
so how beautiful
take him and go there for as well
oh okay
really
battery there
next is it easy to use just a you know easier one will be separate you can't
okay
overlap them
i think it's really easy it's
i'll give it
that's true
oh
okay no one
pretty hard to mess up
what's that one
now it's a two
right
um being as long as the ipod had the spongy holiday
and if you did the latex rubber i use spongy okay
give you one uh
i wonder if it bounces when they dropped it yeah
who then they'd be hard to break character do you like to be less impact we knew where you go out to work
alright and the next is does it integrate some gaussian of fruits and that's all
oh about uh uh well they didn't yeah uh oh
it might be 'cause that's a corporate color isn't it
that's right yeah corporate color we didn't keep that in
you are into video
well if we
i don't make it a little less could a little more confusing but if we had all the buttons and black and designing and the outside and yellow that'd be a corporate one and then we could also have alternative colors one or more conservative one
one more fertility kind of way or something
yeah
you have this um and can we have like an r. r. inscribed on the bottom or something sure
kind of
right so it it really started off but still
so it's i think it's it's kind of a go into oh i i look around and see over here that's the most rich yeah oh uh but there and number
well i'm
i had to
one battery um and the design it match that everybody remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of items that they use the channel being the volume the lowest
i think we really have that hot sony one
yeah in retail
so what
using one of those
yes
okay on also we talked earlier about our applying lines for that
um
for
a whole family
thing
we think that the latex sort of greta
probably take that into account
i think you could still cause i guess you know where you are
it's really hard to do
and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that are constantly pushing that on
i mean i'm one of the best and like outfits and handle
so
and i'd go to jail
uh i'll say two as well because older people that are used to like texting but if i my friend okay
you
well at first
yeah so i'll say to
right
uh huh
easily wearing a
i know you were saying here all winter stuff uh
and now it sort of reminds me of the a guy and i just got i saw read the instruction book and it okay go
and i'm not good at parenting
not really
so i'm going to go
the menu system and uh the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing but i think that's one of one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out but you'll have it afterwards
so i i think i'd give it to i guess
i think it
it's probably a little harder than most most of them because you have to
you have to use the menu system and you have to
tell you what your favorite channels are well could take a better remote object first yeah but
once you if you want to learn how to use it
into the mountains and so on group of
what is it
i think it give it a four to it's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy once you've done it but
hm
all right um
also really read something about losing ends in our math class and that at all
so
we we i think we can kind of see we adjust it with color
okay so in terms of having it do you think that i feel
by the seven
our easier part of that
totally
um and i'm gonna give a little more because i think the
we can still image memory can be a year kind of battery by about anywhere else gonna stay
um right there it give it uh three
yeah it depends how
tidy work on you
to give it for
a cover for 'cause
it would be easy to lose this amount to
i gaussians the simplicity
oh how old is it
i guess just me
all
sports a user simple and design
yeah overall 'cause we've said there were two meetings or simplicity batch and so that was an excitation
yeah
separate from the icsi
like
after that
um
yeah like once we example but it's not like total easily sample so i mean give it
i'll give it a three i guess
we'll give it to
very
oh yeah basketball
's totally fashionable
i don't think that i'm going to fit in half of any bigger i think it's very technology and fashions
so really i i don't know i don't think it's quite especially was my robot or both
i do like that
it requires a double individual together to uh search
the fruit little bit
number uh
so
three
one
and does it need ah like
demographic needs for uh for international heal
that whole thing
so it's sort of our arguments
oh why not
hm
i think as long if we offer it and and
in at least three different color arrangements
oh yeah yeah that's good
so given that 'til
in
she
right you have any other features that they think are important that we didn't talk about
well um we didn't
we didn't address the fact that it does need to have a corporate level so let's
let's make sure we keep in mind that we have that one of our colors concept is for bread and has an art on it while i think all of those emission are yeah
and so we're
yeah so what is it
oh okay
'kay round
oh really
okay now we're gonna look at finances um i have an excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost
um
oh okay
good and others
hm hm
okay um uh yeah i know
really
more space
is you in your work
um
okay
hand dynamo
we use internet batteries right in that yeah
um having one per
when okay
um electronics
single
simple like some some uh
okay
um the case
well uh
just double curved
it is different yeah it's very curry so okay
yeah they get a pinch of it so i don't know
or case material supplements
oh sweet
there's only plastic and
no we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is a seem bad side of it is
the what i guess it was rubber rubber is rubber and special color
yeah
you get more than one special color
yeah we're using all this through special color these two special colors
um i don't know because it the basic color is another yeah
well we know that we're having these three higher so you're saying what are we talking about on each
color combination are we
no well like we have yellow and black
is that
two special colors
i don't know or that andreas wainwright the engines or or
uh
i guess it's three c. three three three ever
i'm trying
maybe are are we in color as well so you know interface we do push buttons yeah but how many buttons do we have
sex
five
oh that sucks with the power
so
anything else
no oh we'll do we'll
all buttons and special colors shapes
the bridge away oh buttons oh so um
so the case is you know we just have one color
right
the normal bodies will be in special colors or making multiple varieties of
this is why i'm getting confused
we're saying per unit
yeah are you okay so each unit will only have one color right in each new button but the cases
could have up to true i mean the buttons could each could be up to three colors is that's how it's designed there i like i like that um
okay
special form
they're all kind of just push button no i think um defined special material you want the rubber as well probably yeah so
oh do you do per button do i
no i don't think so
i think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters
yeah absolutely fabulous 'cause for the whole my case material only one yeah it's minutes to make it rubber okay oh wait maybe
thirteen point seven
oh
yeah
what can we we're gonna just have our buttons all be one color
um a cat like the button is
it's already started to two point three anyway
okay uh i we sort of just double curved maybe it's single but i have no idea we've got
i don't know i didn't get any pictures
yeah it's okay there this is true
it yeah that that one's not yet
okay it's a kinetic battery that's kind of expands and
but we have a simple chip on single curve
case material it is rubber and it's a special color
yeah
but that's important
there's six buttons
oh yeah sixty thousand is just teens
well it's almost thirteen and now it's fifteen
no okay maybe not
i don't know what just happened
for me
now it's twelve
oh was our target price again
talk drawing back oh someone just
so we're okay
right thinking
yeah oh
ish
okay backgrounds that
um stay
i think that too ah um
ah
big shared folder so you know
um okay
actual agenda
oh
um i gather costs under twelve fifty euro yeah yeah yeah they are for the last the project evaluation
project process
satisfaction with for example the room for creativity at leadership
teamwork the needs
any new ideas happened
so i guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating
how we create this project information we got uh menus how we used it
if we're able to um
you know news or creativity with the information
um how old how well i guess i'm glad it's
um
they're how well we work together as a team
um
the digital pens the whiteboard
hm
okay
i'm still very creative
he'd do it
making the prototypes
i think we've been successful in but really
to leave
almost all of the design goals that we set ourselves was not
and we've come up with a finnish project and we just about got separated cost
i think we could have done even better with a little bit more information remotes a single curved case how many colors
what the colors count
um things but given given what we had i think we did we did really well
um
i think we work together pretty well
yeah
yeah i never played that more
market research in industrial thing that had taken them to now but the fruits of vegetables divided by creativity anyway mailing to them the whole thing going to your screen
oh i mean
i do think that would depend little distracting for me personally
like it's having us um
or just being so conscious of
turning the peter down
yeah the bit of a distraction
yeah
right right and
i chose not to do a powerpoint saying that it made sense to us i like that i had the option to do that and just stick my own notes in that sort of thing
yeah i think we all made um very significant contributions i don't think anybody dominated it
which i thought was really good like each of us
was able to um like if you had your information i
um i try to facilitate it with that
like taking over um
yeah you can have little fish products
if there really keep the current war on it it will work at this this bag over there
sure you have that somewhere on the packaging
i have a little trying to think of a good plan that they could add there but
i didn't see that like one single
ooh yeah there are are definitely a c_d in yes
hopefully that would just figured out
some point but
um
could be useful to look at it
of things that you designed up as a huh
okay um what are the new ideas i wasn't
people should really base their boats literature vegetables definitely i know
or or at least we could put creative enough to think of
tucker switches to you
i don't
i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now how else do anything like that
yeah it's no big sense to anybody get watches that happen like really quite expensive watches
that is never need a battery 'cause you always look into it easy to
but in other things i think it'd be really good
and it yeah
a toss
um
okay closing
at the cost in the budget
is the project evaluated
whose final questionnaire and meeting summary
um
so this great product scans i think we've
created something really interesting and then we have a market for it
um
especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we help
um
yeah
make sure in your question or put down
criticisms of
well the process on um
the final results and
yeah real yeah if you like the mercenary mode which is more than one that would be my second job that w. a. second-rate out of the top toggle i'm afraid i mean we don't bring it reveals apparently didn't bring it it it certainly has like what has happened is
as a state government then
ah it
so that's funny
yeah
and this it started as up
care that it started like you were like a bunch of whether anything when i didn't have nothing in between them
yeah
a standard uh
um
hello
we actually bracketed some remote controls comparing them
so ah oh oh oh well uh
but um
yeah
really
congratulations
yeah um
easy to see
nothing will come up with laughter with its posterior as relevant
yeah
um i believe
yeah
it doesn't matter classes anybody this thing like taking matters class that's only going but that's the company words yeah but check it out so like all these like blanks that are gone
you know that all you need to keep in mind your knowledge management
that is what major you don't
well first reduce that make it really to do the job because it's products then uh it's okay
it's it's very work relevant is that it is as they were out
yeah definitely
and they said that they give you links to the corporate website
oh oh here you could see with related to the cover website
it's just just inspiration about circuit boards
it's really oh
it's the world
get it so cool
that would like something is pretty cool yeah so that excel it's one like the program six inspiration um
basically maybe two cents a non flashing blue
that kind of thing thing
um has nothing to yeah my inspiration from from last time this is in the interior of a remote control being taken up a bit by bit talking about circuit boards
i learned a lot actually um i could probably take apart a remote control now if i really needed to
the summer school or we have one table and everything
no hello
circuits and chips and
trends ponders and like i wrote it down because i thought it would be relevant by all the different parts of the inside of a remote control but then
still like you know actually this
he's like mine i would like would you prefer outside his group or multifunction remote control that i didn't have like any kind of table
well something somebody else the question to further school
it's really interesting
i thought it was a little tricky having to hand 'round this
thank you
yeah yeah you need a lot of um
otherwise the technology out today is kind of cool
who knows really how to get
you know m_s_n
we didn't use the whiteboard that much
no
although i don't see how
we could have
very a lot at least for me
i
it is yeah if i had gotten pictures of the different parts of the case
the different looks of the case i would have probably german
you
some applicability anything i think usually like reports are good
no question ideals are like
if we had like a bring they were gonna gonna brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it but then you're going to with only four people it doesn't really
makes sense given that with that and with the powerpoint that we can all look at like you can do all those things pretty much on powerpoint
yeah
does anyone easily sell that
made us more willing to like take notes and uh
like middle characters all needed them separately kind of on the whiteboard in this room
because we're all gonna be working
in different places
yeah
it
if we're all gonna stay here all the time and having the notes up on the whiteboard
but it alright but everyone needs their own like specific notes i guess
now when you were um creating your
um projects or did you work together or did you have like two separate projects
oh bring reports over
um but we were making
what
with so many different shapes and um
discussed uh uh
how the buttons would work
you know
and 's
how we could load improvement
with the swords
there's a bit of both really i just kind of started out by taking a color of clay and
just fooling around that i came out with that run the shape in him and that sort of potato we
mango shape
and then spun from there really
cool
it was fun
it
'cause played anything management i thought well managed
oh
oh really
the first group of people go with things different
much recognition actually
well we did a good job of my
for decisions against it
back scoring they don't have any other type of
and what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have ratings and then
people so just the way we about anything actually really being decided
we figure we don't
proto clearing and decisive
decisive points down there in the meetings so that we
we knew what to want
yeah i was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we were getting
we didn't really have enough um information to make decisions about we're able to do it regardless so
i'm not usually very decisive person set up to have people finish
there's these unable to
keep going
i found that we did it we could have used another five or ten minutes
yeah especially last year we
yeah i think the last um we had a lot of information
in at the same time
not quite enough
you know what i mean
we didn't we couldn't answer every single question
um
but
and i i felt the first two meetings that i was coming in with no information in that sort of
me me you really
i don't know thirty together powerpoint or have no no interested and last time it was like the opposite
and so much information and so much to talk about
is interesting what came out like later like as i was doing then
when i was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um that more points came out from your presentation even
um
the little animals wouldn't that we didn't do uh um
something for losing the remote
yeah that was kind of a big point that was something like
in order to talk about that we would have had to have actual knowledge about
circuit board so that yeah it was like is it only just for creating on the
excel file that wasn't like
that option to select to
so no not included so there is no way we could do like yeah i really didn't do there's no way for us to
continued on that it was really there i think we were just getting over enthusiastic with the task
wanted a single guy into it i mean i got into it
as they went on i got really like what displayed a remote control
professors me but no so
it was interesting though that they cut that fifty percent of people say they have research with liz in the remote and if they didn't provide us with information to
yeah but um
yeah i remember
we should
discuss that
i feel that like people
people have like
things they can put on the keys the precedent they'll be yeah but i but i'm sure that would require some kind of technology that
person or what at least there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things
so you won't lose them you
i don't know i mean we were talking about it and like
in in my household at least there's only about two places but the remote is ever new because there's only one t_v and
there's only like three chair just he isn't always two in the morning
you lose them in your pocket like usual forget that
or like put it down from a there like my exams and then
now remember there's always been so there's things
yeah
it it depends on how organized you are personally yeah are like characters what the side of the house is to you
but i mean
i am sure areas for losing my keeps right i guess up several of them
college
he's in the refrigerator the other five december
so it's pretty close she's away
and um
good good
uh i mean you you take yourself to the bag it for the go-there perpetuated
back to my room
kick it in a cake it is what color i like it should
definitely in vegetables for little buttons
about every single deviate like overnight using a different code
um
yep
well i guess that's good we don't really care to answer that much yeah
can only take into the game and
yeah maybe with a little robot but we could happen have uh
robot alien pair or whatever he's have a little voice thing
i'm david
yeah
no
a t. p. s.
put it into the deep yeah
um
no
so if it's sitting still for machine made when the block by itself it will get them up when you were released and crazy like a lecture magnet that you push it over your individually it's and it didn't look like that is just amelia
just view it it
like you'd have to ever vote for your remote
let it get it in
if you want but if you can attach them to the t_v and yeah
yeah
um
hm
i'm in the mountains those
just
so i'm just um
two nasty minutes
insight into what you have sent to the email saying that powerpoint minutes will be complementary and then like
repeating and just gonna make
making vomit so that it will include all of the agenda and i think
it seems like how
it's kind of like the most typing organizing to do
i didn't have like information to
slot
it is um
how much of your powerpoint was already done for you
every meeting not at it
um i had an slides um
they added a couple slides each time that's fine
and they do anything science 'cause
i would just get slides with titles on the new filter model number
i didn't even think about that one
well the thing was it would provide an agenda list like several points but it wouldn't be assigned for each point
and that's the only way i remember that i had to go to a point
that i know personally when i do powerpoint it's gonna do
and so i had of ones even if it was just like the title of it like the three presentations immediately
did you tell the slogan on it okay just be like
the slogan on in our depending on
with like in durham yeah this is uh no i don't think we need to energy stored in our especially the yellow line
black one
it's a killer blow
or yellow and blue when we go to the web pages
yeah i was just kind of going by the word because they didn't give me any
leah
like you know n_r_a's lower
grown
bring it back doesn't have an ability to
i can tell
it's just beyond like news clipping it's
finish meeting you know
was in it it just seemed that um i thought was interesting that i marked marketing
um the expert did not agree with the marketing um
yeah he enjoys it it's yeah exactly
well perspective you really want to actually uh
oh really big market evaluation you just have
in one set of
source kind of and they work so not backed up would just be a sentence like we did this survey if that's what people um
yes
i don't know
employers do that
yes it it
sort of a grey isn't it
yellow and grey that the slogan the blue
well we got some grey and we have some little buttons we're going
yeah
well they all have electronically
maybe it like
kind of
you know it's
well we're not
sadly going to actually produce a mess though if they ever come out um
with the three of her but it but it about a corpus into words i'm gonna play the intellectual property yeah uh
yeah
particularly the whole days down um until it's been that long
get sucked in
yeah
um i don't know
city
oh
yes
texas
for a second yes
hi grace uh good morning over here
um yeah i want to introduce myself uh many me is uh she the prosody and uh i'm the project manager for this new project which we'll go to discuss now
so i want to introduce first of all uh the names
the colleagues here
and what you're doing
i share my name in segments and i am uh
user usability user interface designer
i said and i do accounting
uh how you spell your name uh e. d.
p. d. k.
do you also do marketing
so only accounting
like electronics
right
and i'm christine and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer
the stupid side
and that everyone
so who's uh marketing nobody marketing is uh this meeting
you know
so uh asks thanks for coming for the meeting first of what
and uh
we have uh
long time just put five minutes to discuss about uh this project and uh the project initiation
first of all i want to ask the distributor about you or a marketing plan a newer product line
and uh
well i think you'll see that throughout the day and how we're going to put this together as a marketing to
to mark
product
we'll have to see
uh through discussion about where we're gonna go from
yes
hm
a bit to be already have like a functional design or a technical design uh for the moment idea
for the moment not yet okay but uh what's what's your brother do you have some project plan
something
sure
good question
no it's like i said we have to be discussed between all of us and will go for
exactly
he needs a program to work out the other
okay so
oh by when you think and you can uh
give me some kind of uh project plan
okay discussion it's really about the next meeting
my next meeting okay that'd be great
uh
okay so there's any questions or the poster for
what uh
this project
where's the call project
uh the goal of the project i think maybe i will uh handle to the heat
it's my
uh probably
but he's in the sale sign the colon and the sailor so they explain what to do
where they define exactly what our product is from uh
yeah it's uh can you explain uh what exactly the book series
for what i had on mine
we're supposed to marketing coffee
is that great
uh i think uh i'm not phone we are making the remote control remote controls cause i had two different things i have the first part of mine was to make a remote control for new remote control for television
i'd have to i had a discussion about coffee so
we'll start with the remote control for television now
so we have to design something that is very user friendly
something uh
visually has something that we would draw people to buy the product
because i think everybody's experienced with the remote controls some remote controls are hard for for throwing out the window
uh um
most of all that i don't know we have to come up with a new idea
how to make it
a lot easier to use
um
it's a lot of times
spend
half a day through the
construction but trying to figure out how to use it
yeah yeah
and uh
what about the kristin what about your uh the industrial design line
what do
have a design already on this
product or the
you're still working on the design
um
no i i have not began working on the design
and um
i uh
i actually didn't know we were designing a remote control i thought we were designing a new monitor um
the
website i went to look at
had some announcements about an introduction of a um
uh some sort of a seven inch hound monitor
and um
i
understood that that was the project goal
so um i'm glad i didn't do any work um ahead of time because
i really didn't understand the project goal
yeah
um
i just
i did see that we're starting a new project together and that was before member team compared to these people
and um
that's bad then
that's and i i read through the different steps and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps
so you'd be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the t.
the design of for the industrial design yes
um why would they think that depends on how much money you give tax
if he doesn't really because uh you know he can they can make it uh
yeah different choices have different financial markets yeah but there before we talk about the the finance okay
uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market
and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's still individual also
well you know um i kind of think that in general you have to do uh
um yeah you have to have something very fashionable
that's a very attractive that um
people see and recognize its goal and uh they immediately wanna have it uh
have one of their own so it would it really would need to um
something like the ipod would be good seems to have quite on fairly well so
um
you know okay what it does just so it looks cool
okay
but uh uh when you think you can give me like uh
kind of decide on the functional design of the technical design
well i got a lot of the projects i'm doing right now
um and so i'll have to wait and see how those uh have those go if they uh go quickly and then it could be a month with um
if i run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months
yes but uh i need something in the writing so like uh what's your functional design what's your technical design
and uh how many people you need for this project and what's the time frame you're looking for in a in the what the budget maybe uh initial particular working
okay and uh always going to the market okay so you you had to meet with the marketing team another way to market and what the marketing strategy plan
okay when are you going to introduce okay and by the time introduce the product a day in order that would be a competition okay so i need some kind of uh
well
the
plan in the lighting from you
okay
any logical thing
as soon as possible
i have one
if uh
if we have enough time uh
then then do you seem to um
two weeks is uh is close enough
yes i think that would be good because i need to go to the management tender tell them what we are going to do and uh what's cost is okay and what's the time frame when what's the project plan
because uh without any documentation so i cannot put it on management and says okay we'll want to do this and we need this much money okay so then
it's it's difficult for me to say will fit the season i need uh some kind of plan from you initially okay then we can how the for the discussion again
uh
are there other people who will be contributing to their plan
yes of course if you did some helper also let me know so the people you need the from the marketing or uh the technical side or the administration point of your key to add in your documentation or some technical point obviously just like my nose like an important at all the intel can get plenty on this thank you
and uh it uh so what's what you think about uh
this project
for the remote control and did you have some already one something for your marketing strategy or the same strategy
well now yeah other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh what are building
their designs their ideas uh
also to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into
yeah
there should be a fairly large market because uh
the number of people that uh
competition
um
uh i agree it has to be something it has to be something
has to be something that that draws people say hey i like
yes
whether worse or not in any of the first say i like this i like the design
and there's gonna be some changes
yes
so what i uh for for maybe uh you need to imply uh more with the christie okay because
you know what she's going to do
okay and you know how to serve it
i see
because
uh she's doing the design but you're the core because you're the marketing okay is that you need to sell any you're responsible for the all the money the finance okay two more
so what i for for okay so you need to interact with a christian more and have it in her team okay with splitting the functional design and our technical design okay and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan okay how we are going to do those
your cells but
okay the audio cost
no but on this the an idea of how much uh we want to mark this four edges of the cell for a headset
that's up to us to decide here so that you ought to decide okay so the best thing is you well both of uh the christian and you will discuss with you also locate and come up with the cost and how we are going to
compete in the market okay and uh
technically or in the sales wise look at the commercial wise
okay then we ought to design okay how long it will take the whole project okay
how much is going to cost us and how much we're going to benefit for the company
okay
of course it's it's uh of of
but for for everybody individually
okay
so i think it's uh maybe if he can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan okay
including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the t. okay then it will help me to discuss with the management for for the booking and put it in the the proper project plan
and if you need it
any coordination in between uh come back to the maybe there are some technical going there so commercial vendors okay depends if you want to have some of our marketing plan or technical plan okay so let me uh
okay i can't recall any
or maybe
uh
you might call it on monday
um between uh
well no not exactly i mean my job from what i understand was
so like at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use that one like of the best ways to do that
yeah
so i think i'll have to interact with christine as the best of her yeah
so that she's not designing something back
my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work and so it's sort of it's only that feeds them but
i don't think necessarily that
i mean
and a coordinating
position yeah so basically you need to interact with christine more okay for the user acceptability
yeah yeah and the testing only then which will also feed into the marketing yes depending on what users want depends on how you sileye it might tag lines you attach to a
how you do it
make it more attractive to user so i think
all three groups so we'll need to interact quite a bit
and um
i guess build the plan based on all of that exists and you need to take all the factors into account
what a request okay the keep it in the low yeah i see you are uh meeting in christian meeting because i should know what's happening yeah we can see see ends on many discussions of most and reasonable on the males look at all the discussions to me because i need to submit to the manager
uh-huh
so any questions for our time being
so the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design you this
so come on the functional design and uh to discuss with and locate how it would work and the cost of quality work
user acceptance yeah okay how it looks like and how it's going to work in the market
okay
so then we can discuss about uh four other things so
and uh
we're just um
for me
okay
thanks for coming with mine um
at the conclusion of a meeting could do could you send us a copy of your slides
yes ma'am i rent movies yes
i copy uh let let us keep all the emails and all the copies of appreciate each other okay so you know everybody what's happening
sure
okay
and if anything you need any time so please i do you can call me or just send me email or uh
just come and uh lock my door okay so on my machine
good thank you
okay thank you
and swimming in the ocean i stand there
yes
see like
oh
chances are
as entertainers
for uh this one
see our point is here
um i didn't know no so yeah
and it disappear and he's
he's
thing of interest this they go i don't need to that's for sure
okay uh
it is
begin and information i mean
hope you will come back
i hope for you have uh fresh air you know in the first time
how is it now the meeting actually we
gathering here
to discuss about the functional design
mate
yeah and uh we'll see some information from uh on a few indexing uh i think uh
the shading folder and i will invite uh the sixteen ending eight and uh agnes to discuss it work on the various subjects
so you can go to the next slide
uh the agent of the meeting is opening
then uh
i'm going to talk about uh the project management what i'm going to do and uh of course i'm doing a project management executive board
if we can take the minutes of the meeting
and they'll have three presentations one is the new project well mine's
and the segment wanted a decision on remote control functions
and uh finally we are closing uh the meeting time maybe i'll forty minutes
so you oughta be very quick
and i'll come up with the management with the new proposal okay i'm going to discuss with you one of those
oh what's this
new insides
in the aim of your project
but the one is uh
the teletext becomes uh all models
okay because of uh because of the computer systems and uh new technology
so
we don't need to constantly about the teletext at all in our new project design
the second one is about uh
the remote control
should be jewels only for the t_v
that's what our management says
i'm not taught avoid it so well waiting for them
to test operation or the marketing or the corporate image
okay with this new project called new project
so i mean why uh
agnes can you go to the corpus yeah
and this is the third site
okay good
so
i lean my to just change to discuss about uh the functional design
okay now
and
yeah
so
um
um or to
yeah yeah
john mister john miller
i don't know see
yes
so why um
why i figured uh
we should
um i identify some user requirements and from my experience i wanna uh uh and from
the research i did
uh the
the device has to turn television on and off the first time you press on the big button you can't tear
can have like a war falling on this point two million that he needs to be able to be able to find it
because one of the 'cause problems with
remote controls 's
finding them
so uh i also since we have to establish a corporate image on the basis of this new product
do they look at things that are popular and um picks go beyond those and as i said and first meeting
um yeah and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the constructions especially the yeah the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance and is reliable and so forth
i did a little history on um the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth so
i guess this guy had seen if i created the flash dramatic
check out like the idea because it made me think of um uh um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the t_v on and off that might be interesting
and um 'kay so it was a highly directional flashlight
then uh you could turn the picture on and off and the sound on and off and change channels so i think um those are still requirements we have today uh
fifty years later
and uh we was really a pioneering innovation but it was so sensitive to the sun so that day would get would start off by the you get
with
easily cause um problems
so i
i in addition to uh looking at the um
uh the functional press all these devices are examples of where uh d_v_d they can represent
examples that are available today
i think that one in the middle
as a person
something to keep in mind be easy to find
hands down
it would yeah he'd
he could for it things if the t_v didn't turn out off you could
use it for something else
and since i'm not really um
uh industrial designer i didn't know what to do with this slide
but um
i just took some
different uh schematics and i put them into this and i guess this is what the site might look like if you were drawing a circuit board again that i i don't know why i am
rest is
so
uh
personal preferences
um
i think we could uh i'm really thinking outside the box here i think that we should consider perhaps
having an i_d and at the size up
a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference so something is very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it
i think
um you could either be you could go either one extreme be very colorful or you could make it clear and um kind of
blend in with things so you don't have to um uh have a problem with that the the decoration of the of the users home
um i think uh it needs to be waterproof because uh sometimes they fall into cups and you know might be about a swimming pool or something like that
um
if you i remember what what my requirements was about it needs to to tell you when it's done its job or not because at the time i keep pushing on the remote control and i don't know if it's actually
understood my message so i think it should give you some sort of an oral cue
and now course i never wanna replace the battery
so that's those are my preferences and that's my presentation
yeah let me uh interrupt you uh if you can add other facilitate other creature light uh unbreakable
yeah ice hockey because uh
especially today you know you have a family and the k. it's okay and the kids draw tend to play with the remaining time with the color yes okay so if he can add the future okay before you or or fabric whatever you the overall plan design okay with unbreakable locating that will give
a lot of advantage
for our product
good angle
good idea how how how you can uh add it in
yes okay
okay uh thank you justin and uh uh any questions or uh classifications or
any discussion on the functional design
do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials
'cause for example in the unbreakable thing doing something plastic would be
harder where it is
having something like
i know steel or titanium isn't really economically
yeah
yeah possible will be handy to yeah
no i haven't really um
i want feedback i think we need to re rank these yeah but we'll see what you're a choice no preferences are no i'm just wondering whether
do you have any
i like titanium it's a light
yeah
expensive
yeah a marketing company
it was great you know nobody told me how much what our financial objective is so i'm
yeah
if you already inflate something it made you do it uh
this is the last meeting we're supposed to discuss about the financial thing
uh let him go quickly maybe if he can go back
and working project plan on the budget
oh
yes
so
so
yes
yeah it's christians so
this thing
that's my
uh i think a little about how i will send you locate the project maybe the the project eight one k.
or the end of the day the company uh wants to make at least uh fifty million euros
okay
and uh of course applies will be ready reasonable on uh the sales side okay that maybe you give a talk to work the how much the price and the what's there
how much it's cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be the sale in the market
then uh you can combine it with your feedback and uh i have one maybe there is additional being in this remote control okay
it can be for like a movie with should be used for any t_v
okay
and it would be silly
okay and uh
that
not fat
might be hard to find
but let's try it okay all the different uh the designs okay the functional designs
so any other questions
uh from her side i don't think uh
there's too many questions
okay
thank interested for uh time being sold and uh
right
thank you to the marketing uh for the marketing side just to to give an idea what the manager is looking for
but
looking for uh
a remote control to um excuse me
oh
right
i have a sail price of twenty five euro
with the production price so tall and half a euro
from what uh i think from or trying to find which one we're looking for i don't think the price is exactly
in the mark
right
okay now i'll explain myself you know in the sense that uh
in the recent surveys
uh from the ages from fifteen to thirty five eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as train
twenty five euros uh that's
but it's pretty reasonable cause it's more proprietary
yeah for a take a risk yeah
it pushed us up a bit
make it more expensive but give them added things that they don't have now yet
then they would they could possibly so obviously the risk is there too expensive than a combine
what
i think uh uh there's one other thing interesting to think that interesting idea
is that uh from a fifteen to thirty five year old room
which always spends more money on the train the new things
speech recognition is request
we're talking between age seventy five to ninety percent
of this group is one to pay for speech recognition i'm not
obvious we can make a remote into a computer but maybe simple commands
lower
softer
on off
that might be a possibility even though it costs more
to be the first on the market to produce that
thirty five percent say the two difficult to use
so what freer we make and more user friendly
uh fifty percent so they can't find the remote half the time
so maybe one word speech recognition commands save remote and there's a beep beep beep and they can find it through you know ten ten the newspapers magazines whatever you have at all
but
the cost that uh the management is looking for are starting to be possible
but if it's trained if it's fancy it's got some color to
it's very easy easy to use it does get simple remote speech remote uh control
what pieces of our software change channel
all off
remote because be people like a fireman we'll without spending half a day looking for getting all of cycling can turn the t_v off
so we have to look at it and
in this global idea
would
the ideas
did a show
uh design
hi so obviously we have to talk
so what do you think about uh
the design set distance do you think you can make it or or
uh i'm sorry
where did you go about uh the design of what was talking about speech recognition speech recognition
well uh training is always an issue
okay then
commands so um might to uh
we can um
perhaps um
do it
if the user is willing to
spend some time in the training process so it could reduce the
uh
the overall um
cost
i'm sure how
but um anyway um
uh um
uh i think also that the this might impact the battery life
and um so maybe what we'll have to do is
um add something where you can
recharge it
wirelessly
so that do you do you have any sense in power to it
so or maybe yeah set up the sign in the tag you know gets a from the light
um has a solar cell inside there so that uh you have enough
yeah
it used to do all these fancy things
it seems also like with the speech recognition yeah it's a great feature but if you're watching t. v. there's a lot of ambient sound and it's words it's not just you know noise is like something hitting
it's actual speech so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough
to filter out the t. v. speech
and the the user's speech otherwise you can say remote but if someone on the screen is saying the same thing
all of the sudden you have someone in a movie saying often your screen dies
because they've trigger the remote control and it's turned out for t_v
so
i think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems
thing yeah be a really good marketing gimmick but
i think we seriously need to consider how that would imply
it's
the situation very good um
oh yeah
with speech recognition uh
oh no
yeah
um good a bad idea but um
if it's oh one more
recognition because i know telephones in cars and things i've seen in the stacey uh front minuses column all i calls up mode
yeah
okay the radio can be on and everything
because i think's with speech recognition of uh uh remote control like telephone
has it
exactly or
that has to here
i don't think it would come through a sentence
television
somebody speaking on the said in the television i stop and say
remote
mm yeah
so i think that uh something could be designed to recognize a single woman oh yeah
yeah
well i think it's a great idea
if we can design it and say this is your everybody stays with this program is called
so called immediately and then
so it's kind of cute
well what i can uh suggested kristin okay uh if you need some memory model
the technical feedback
or some time
okay
about uh this facility especially for the speech recognition
i can become a new some companies like uh interior or i. p. um quickly because they're already in this speech recognition part okay
and they can maybe have some uh technical backup on them some kind of for technical tire
okay uh if you want i can coordinate we'll get to get some information
okay and then uh let me go okay so what kind of uh
the details you require
okay to add this feature
in this project
i don't think it's uh the difficult
and uh we need to know how much is that time frame you need to do that
apart from what
really
we'll get we'll find that out
from from your side there you have to go back to management 's
yeah it's the most precise what do they want uh
or risk
take a risk on the market something is gonna cost one but could per user release it may come home in the market
'cause a seventy something totally different hasn't always told me something that nobody has right
yes dreamcast end of the day you're the sales guy so i will come back and sit on your hard because you're going to be real says production okay
it's uh of course it's um with joe well tell the management how much it's cost as a normal job and she went first okay
and uh so i don't mind to convince okay the management to spend some more money on the project okay if you can make all of
well there's
money from this well why the sponsors i don't mind to come as though the management okay the management says okay so that they don't want certain facilities which it's already war work if they want something the new okay i think uh like a speech recognition definitely there lately i don't think the signal for the shapes and uh i hope i can convince the management
okay
so if you have any a new idea also cure for uh you can always combine the you can tell me if you need any
uh as special okay uh coordination of cubic linear technical company which you can uh
high tech technology back up
okay
for fun
hello
simple design okay then i'm very computer
and uh what's your comments about uh
uh huh
well maybe if i go through my presentation you can sort of see what the user perspective is and how it ties into the other two comments yeah
so you'll finish it uh so i can uh
okay i yeah i know to me um
spring
schools
yeah i just
yeah
right
let's see two three oh yeah that's right
okay
so
basically
the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like when people don't like about existing products in our case existing remote controls
and then what the good ideas are and what the bad ideas are and why they're bad and good which is always is obvious we seem to have intuitions about why
things are good or things are bad but when you look
technically at how it works sometimes that's not the case
then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep is that'll feed into both
and work in kristen's work
um and then what the remote control should look like obviously once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are
so in terms of the functionalities that we need you obviously need to be able to turn the t_v on and off you need to change channels both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing you need to build to control the volume and then controlling the menus on the t_v
to regular contrast or whatever
so the problem is that people have expresses that there's too many buttons on remote controls in general
the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do
um often we need to know specific button sequences
to get certain functionalities time um which you don't necessarily always remember especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often
and that the buttons are too small
so here we've got two examples where
here on the left hand side you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons the buttons in a lot of cases are tiny
um they're hard to see and okay they're labeled but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much whereas on the other side you have a much simpler remote control
i think basically has the minimum functionalities
that are needed and it sort of looks simpler and just
less imposing when you first look at it so i would be inclined to go sort of towards this
in terms of design and rather than this
and if there's specific functionalities or require more buttons or we can figure out how to do it with existing
um buttons
so my personal preferences i had to keep the number of buttons to limit our to minimum sorry
make frequently use buttons bigger and more strategically place so like the on button being really obvious one
the channel changing and the volume
and to keep the design basically sleek and simple
which i think ties into what christine and adam both said
fairly reasonably
um so that's pretty much it and
i don't know if you guys have any
questions or
alright so uh um it seems to be very understandable clearly your research and uh
an hour's uh heading in the same direction
yeah and um
yeah
the one thing that i saw missing for um uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it yes that's true so uh you know but that's okay that's why we're all your table so that if we think of it in our research indicates certain things and um
it was complementary
i also think then it's um
uh
the uh the feel of it
is uh
when you hold it
is something that um
it was expressed more in in in in my uh
design oh and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters the industrial designer is more thinking about political look-and-feel
and uh that's definitely a very important factor especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost done
daily basis in a lot of cases i think
oh okay so have any questions sounds good
so
for anybody need uh any help for time being
on this the subjects okay so
this come back to me and uh just and maybe i can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical
other companies to help you for a make a design uh slim
okay and to add some features like what we're talking for the speech recognition and on
should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include cause we thrown a lot of features onto the table but
do we actually want to incorporate all of them or
we missed anything
you wanna go back and look at the closing slide maybe that would provide some guidance
so
doesn't tell us uh
really this logic was just individual actions
it's it's user interface so i suppose to do the components concept
supposed to work on the user interface concept and you're supposed to keep watching the trends
uh um in specific instructions will be sent by ah
oh sure
i thought we shouldn't do was the main features just to start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process that's my suggestion
okay that would be great
and uh i'll send you uh the major object if you want
i'm just thinking in terms of time is objective
yes no not active no you
i'm just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away i mean it takes a lot of
time and effort
for everyone to
consider different features
um
and if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use maybe it's better to spend it
on the
thinking more about features that we actually do want but
so why don't you just using his name for after the meeting because we are meeting time is run and somebody else you gotta use this round and you know we can't hang out here yeah into this so
okay what will this little will take for lunch break okay then uh we can discuss for them or
with our ideas and then we can find
no
so thanks for coming in the sentiments of meeting and uh please put your all information in the shelling folder so everybody can share information
okay
so let's go for lunch time
agree very much
oh
okay
yeah
yeah
oh welcome back
hope to lie
oh were you had a good lunch
yeah
oh
uh this meeting maybe i can tell she uh to discuss about uh
conception
design meeting
yeah
and uh agenda will be
don't want me to find uh that uh
the project manager or secretary that's me and the the presentations from the 'cause steve
and uh
'kay notice
and then you see a
finally in this meeting we have to decide
and you know to make a decision on the remote control
concepts
and uh
the functional design
so we are forty minutes
i think it's uh
it could be uh no but i i hope we can finish it up
so i'll hand go to the uh
the functionality to the kristin we're here to discuss about uh the components
concept
okay
so uh if you could open the powerpoint presentation
i'm number two
to
components design
so uh could put it in slide show oh yeah
right here
it's that little that one yes please thank you
yes
so why um
and we were looking specifically at the components uh the following components
uh the case the power supply
uh means of communications with the television set
and then since we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition you have to have a microphone well na dementia haven't
have to have a microphone in the device
but um
maybe it did have it
away has to has to hear the speaker
and um so it could be the televisions that could be in the device but somewhere you have
put the microphone
um and know a way of making beeps or sound so you can find it when it gets lost
um so the other thing that we
so
a method for
going about this is we've looked at uh at the store at the historical record what's worked for hasn't
and then we also were um
they wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because
course we
might come up and choose the material that in manufacturing didn't have the technologies capabilities to offer us so uh this is the approach that we took during our um her research
so um for the case
um we told we were making this best case specific assumption that it would be curved in design course no i wanted it to be expand the ball and shrink a_b_l but
uh and that doesn't seem to be one of the choice not an option we can
we can really seriously explore
so then we were thinking about um rubber but um
and fortunately that's been limited because of the heat uh factor and then um there might be some
problems with them and uh how it's
that goes with the board
uh and uh then plastic also has this problem melting and is brutally 'cause brittle after a while so um still had titanium in in what available
but um and fortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh the people in manufacturing said that could make curved cases that have titanium although
hello
apple did it with good
powerbook i'm not quite sure but
uh nevertheless so um they've eliminated all of our options except white
so
i just
and it is she said it's an environmentally friendly uh material so
were were
playing a proposed thing
i will get all my personal preferences in just a sec
so does this other matter of the chips and them well we could use a simple design on the board but
uh simple chips but that's only works for the bayes you don't give very much um intelligence with the simple one
and um then that was their regular which
i regret that i've forgotten exactly
why yeah i'm eliminating that one
uh the other option was this advanced chip-on-print
and uh we like it we we found
uh it it includes infrared sender which would never the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip
and uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip-on-print so
uh would we uh
now gypping right to our personal preferences
well um yeah i really think we should you know use some of us um really exotic words
like um you know
uh well you guys come from tropical countries so you can can think of some trees and some nice woods
i think that
people might really want to design their own cases you see they could do sort of a this um three dimensional design on the internet and then they could submit their borders can like you submit a custom car order you know and you can choose the color the size of the wheels and the colors of the leather and things like that and then i uh i think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip
so this is the findings so if our research and my recommendations
uh for the new remote control um would be to have um
have been made out of wood
any problems with that
can go back uh one slide
i'm not sure how i know i know this let's go back up here this uh
i'll question uh
what's mean exactly he wants to see
well
pretty fucking okay
i think it's um that um on multiple uh chip design
um and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board
uh i could find out more about that is the the for the next fit next meeting is it or not like was like also restore uh
i don't know but i'll find out more next week it will that would be great so the finder mode but modified remove this so that would be cool sounds good
oh the plastic wouldn't it is impossible to because um
it gets brutal
crack 's
um
and um
we want we expect these um
and these remote controls to be around for several hundred euros
so
yeah
it it
the expression goes crazy
well after us
cool
i'm to speak for yourself i would
oh
i think with the window you run into the same types of problems with me i mean it chip set if you drop but
it's i'm not sure
yeah
three hundred combines actual relative
yeah but i think in the cell if you use really good quality work that might work but you can't just you know
i don't see where julia making use of that was a hard text yeah that way but there's some very creative output
um that's actually a very innovative idea
okay go ahead
so are having a hard time keeping remote control of my it's
it's actually a very innovative different idea that uh you you can choose your color would
type work
um
this thing to meet each person at any other personalized individualized
speech recognition remote control in what
's
not on the market
semantically seems quite uh the design the functional design uh what would you do
um
in terms of comments on that surgeries as my only as well
i don't know what supposed to be
she works in a cubicle next to me so she's actually this already a little bit prepared for this uh
what we had was now i'd i
yeah
yeah
i mean get the quality materials and then
it shouldn't influence the design principles to match which you'll see with my presentation one thing we'd have to check those with the users whether
how quickly the novelty wears off and not having you would wanna have to have splinters in your yeah value for example
so
have to see how
kid friendly and it's and
and all that but
so like if your dog gets a hold of it they can use it
i
for tea thing
i do that with rubber plastic so
yeah they do
materials as well yeah
joe moore
okay then uh let's move to uh i mean
sure
you know possibly true
so
okay so
so it's a very short presentation because i'm actually gonna try the layout on the board so
if you wanna just go straight to the second slide
uh which basically shows sort of it've the ideas that we're talking about last time
um and try to put that
into the remote control so the things that you can actually see on are are the on off switch
volume and channel control the menu access button
ergonomic shape which i completely agree with christine 's idea to have it sort of moulded so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the standard very straight remote controls
actually i think what the what if we take your customizing idea
is that people can actually do sort of quality measurements on their hand size of someone has larger hand my illnesses why different size on your words for example
so that's actually really good idea of customer customize ability
um one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip-screen on it just like you have on flip phones
so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally pressed her hand on especially if you have little kids around they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch t_v sharon accidentally change the channel or during um
health so
i had issues with batteries running out so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life light
on it that kind of goes domain demand emma as your batteries starts to die
uh and in terms of invisible features audio and um tactile feedback on button passes um um and like you said speech recognition
so in terms of uh what
they might actually run by
despite working in interface design not various errors and also you know are different
to have something like that as well
on off switch fairly they
sort of in a corner in by itself
so you don't accidentally turn your t_v off either trying to maneuver the buttons
and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays
or
channels
and volume
sort of for surfing channels and then volumes of volume would be up and down
volume is up and down and then channel structure right
and then here you have your sort of standard
telephone ish
number
and then on one side you would have access to the menu
on your t_v
and on the other side
a way to turn off the voice control
so that if the user doesn't want to use their voice they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control on accidentally
changing things like that
um so if you could have a lousy light somewhere
i like
and
right
i don't know
so as you can see it's a very very simple design which is one of the things i really wanted to keep
keep it simple and not have too many buttons not have too many functionalities turn into it
i think the design can pretty much carry over to everything although with a with a flip-screen
like you have to do something slightly
hinge
we like a copper and sure yeah we just have to start watching if in a way it's depending on how much the the flip-screen why it away
um i don't know control only to start getting to have
but that's the general layout with the general functionalities
on something else
as you can see there's still lots of space up there for a very small
and if you do it customize it maybe
we can make this thing fairly small uh about it
no no
personal preferences
so
that's pretty much
all i had to say i mean everything else in terms of design issues
i'm the centering of the keypad and
the channel is just depending on where your thumb is
and you tend to use the the volume control and uh
the browsing more than the actual number pad so that would be sort of interactive liner for your thumb goes when you're holding your remote control
the number of have a little bit lower cause it's used less frequently um um
so once we decide exactly what we want then we can figure out the zap positioning
but more or less it can get you go along those lines
so what's your uh
comments or uh
simple design
so customers won't
okay
sounds like you still have a productivity
yeah
probably is obviously going to cost
um
okay i also
very simple
presentation is come from a marketing point you have to see what the consumers want
also uh
copied uh
different type of remote
if you
fine
all right bad
the show would be one in here
right
try
much
sure
to be modified
we're still being recorded
my name is simple
questionnaires in different areas because there was obviously we have to see whether congress consumers are looking for today access uh trends changing very very quickly
and six months maybe this idea has already gone out the window so it's gonna question how fast we can act
uh they already are interesting my uh
no
quarterfinals no
so we go to
uh the market train
this is what we know from the last uh from mine
questionnaires and level although servers we've done fancy feel good that's what we were looking for something that feels good in the hand that's easy to use
looking for next generation of innovation because all the remotes out there now they're all very similar they all do the same thing
yeah something completely
okay
easy to use as always become has become another major interest that uh
with the whiteboard we can see it's a remote that's easy to use
and i think this is another thing is interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting selling technology
so even if we are our product that may be more expensive
if it comes out right
if they didn't look at looks and feels good and has technology
the second two you can see the last one is a very easy simple design
the second one there's about uh uh forty five thousand different buttons on it which makes it fairly hard to read per ideas the first one i see
that they put in a display
or something else and with a little flip-open already what kinds of things simple we do flip-open table display on the flip-open one close it everything's locked
yeah
maybe the display also makes it easier to use because sometimes and you like it for buttons maybe if you see a display
context sensitive instructions
oh okay running a much better but no the t_v or the davey d. or something else i've seen specially mostly the standard really sounding speech alienation yeah you have one with a very simple also the idea is simple but with the display
so you could see what you're doing
so maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use
trendy fancy
feels good
uh
with the display
would design a wood designer colors
yeah maybe magic or d. s. n.
somebody orders the device
the kids send them like um
he uh
uh
some sort of phone rubber
uh um
older yeah and then they would squeeze it they would take the shape of their hand yeah so that was really molded to his ears were sitting there and then you would know like
um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh called the screen
really
i don't really
right
but that for that you gotta do sort of an average across families and that's right and so you would not less than everyone has their own personal remote that that actually would increase the um the resonator
yeah
true true
no but incorporating the three uh
obviously do something totally new on the market
yeah
totally different
so already the customize ability is
a really good sort of
when you get with the uh with uh nokia the chemo
changeable covers
um yeah taking more into another phase taking off chronic depression
and and that's not really so millions
millions
so
so with the flow the findings when the research is easy to use something totally new
we have to come up with something totally new that's not
we'd also have to work um consider that to who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes to my
one and learn about um labor wise
you know in different countries and stuff where so we can do it cheap but don't want to exploit uh labor in um
third world countries
to actually to turn it you turn around and say that you're um part of the reason the cost is high for the devices because
um you're paying uh a working wage to the person who made
the device
but we can get a production in uh
countries like uh cast in many ways yeah yes and just like in your chain or a male she also
you can build better features and butterflies and you can some more
so
that would that be something that manufacturing would have to
yeah um
yeah explore more and and as to where where many fashion is is
than other stuff
yeah we're here to design
yes uh but uh that's the problem i can talk about the production later it depends on the the quantity of the um um so we don't need to have our own one uh fabric factory or something so we can have a carpeted room
to do the fabric okay with the different uh electronics items then we can have a
business trial uh because there are quite the cost
to sell more
so
but the let let's decide first about uh components concept and uh interface concept
very good is
except for for both of you what uh it was talking
and your design
with uh you wanted the display or without display or just simple so
i think it depends i mean i think it's a good idea but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the t_v you already have
a big display right in front of you
um
so
if we're trying to keep the costs down
then maybe sacrificing the display
um
is the way to go i mean depends on how much putting a display cost and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for and um 'cause if it's only used for one little thing then putting in a big display case for big display that's
probably expensive just to do the training on the chip
for the speech recognition or whatever
may not be the most cost efficient way to go but
that's just sort of speculation i mean
i would think in june
you like the display and one of the concepts that you show
um do you know how much it costs uh
um
to to add a little display like this right
so
when they can actually um so find down
it's
cause we have to find out cost out
okay
sorry about that last no problem i'm from pushing it after it's made
oh marketed
once we get a price on it then we
marketing
so
the advanced chip-on-print is but um
well we've
what we decide
determined in the uh
engineering industrial design is the recommendation
and um i think we've kinda come to us um
agreement regarding um
this concept of a wooden case
yeah
and customizable and
nice
good thing how do what about you but this will
when the buttons we went to uh
uh i don't think so so now i think they could be rubber glacier now so you have that little tactile experience of
yeah so
well what we'll do is uh we'll we'll stick with uh the simple design for timing until uh i find notes about uh how much it's cost of extra in case people for the display
okay so maybe what you can do is um both of you can come up with uh
the program 'kay
with people more than okay
okay
sure
so well um
are we done this meeting
uh i hope for is it okay uh they will have come up with the prototype design
okay then they can show you how it looks like and then we can uh submit to the
i would submit to the management
okay
then in the time you can come with a price how much it cost is extra for the the display
a marketing strategy is really strictly legal
on fire
to sell extra
of course you make money total so
followed by your weight when it will commission
okay so any questions
so by next meeting so please come up with uh the prototype
okay and uh then we can try something yeah
good good
oh
so thanks for all your uh efforts
and coming for the meeting again
and the season
okay okay thank you
so um
uh huh
yeah
on the regular delay
yes
well like everybody
sure
i see
so this meeting agenda will be detailed
design meeting
and uh
opening the p. of the second of the meeting minutes uh prototype presentation from uh the steve
yeah
i need
oh it's
yes same the evaluation criteria yeah
the finance uh it's uh from my side from the management and uh production evaluation
then uh closing so we have forty minutes
to discuss
and uh finalize and
close
uh product project
i didn't follow that
so
okay let's talk about uh maybe first uh
for the prototype
yeah okay
so and and so
i don't know presentation but it pretty much covers work that we have done so
if i'm missing anything just interested in writing as me to do
yeah
can you go to
yeah my
it's not the biggest powerpoint presentation oh
is it two or three or three
don't think it's the last one called
uh huh
no
then it's it's like look at that
final design
yeah it named appropriately just couldn't see any
um okay okay
yes
's
alright so
from them when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting we decided that we wanted ergonomic shaped material that we chose was weight
and that the color would be customizable you can stay in the way
whatever color
um
so in terms of function you have to be able to turn the t_v on and off volume and channel control menu control voice recognition control
and we've incorporated the l. c. d. screen on the flat panel as part of the design if we figure out it's too expensive problems to get
um so
to on bail
ah lovely products
this is
our remote control
with the flat-panel as you can see
so if you like tap
the panel
you can save that lovely yellow l. c. d. display
um
it's actually part of the of the yellow button you have a on-off button so it's really big hard to mess
you have the
they read um
triangles or the toggles or
changing the volume up
volume up and down volume down
the green r. the channel changing
then that's one of those very like very touchable displays
and then you have the numeric pad
in the dark blue with the bottom
and 's all in
the right hand side you have
the access to the menu on the t_v and on the left hand side
he had uh
he
the the ability to turn off the voice recognition
so this is pretty much what we had on the whiteboard the last time
um and uh it's
yeah additional feature on the back
as you can have your own customized
backing and i suppose you could do the same thing on the flat case on the front
so that you can really make this a highly highly customizable remote control
we haven't uh um
uh specified where the speaker where the microphone would be placed
that depends um the design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left
um yeah
i think the microphone is on the top
oh yes okay so
mid of late
so that would be the save
so
we need the chip
it's not on the chip because you need to home it
one of those number depends on the design of the circuit board
yes but he shouldn't be under the flip either because you can have the remote control close but you still might want to
well to develop a voice yeah but uh
in my opinion i think it's better under the flip because when all you want to
the talk okay so then you can speak then you can close it
but if you put it on the on the flip okay then uh
technical i i don't think it's a feasible
because most of the time is beginning to recognize that if you already got the remote control your hand need to open the flip to use the voice why use the voice why not just use your hand
i mean the whole point of the voices their remote control is sitting there and i'm too lazy to reach over and pick it out
i can just use my voice the gap my hand in the popcorn bowl and um holding my cup of coca cola and the other hand
yeah
you don't wanna like go by the robot
yeah
i mean it doesn't have to be on the flip it can be on the side of my exercise sides movies work so that's great and so i mean i can pass around it
yes it's on wednesday
yeah they replace them with a napkin
i see
this lapel microphone on the side i would have you probably would have been a bit a missionary thing to be accessed um all the time to voice
yeah exactly
so he's been doing
so um
couple most of the artists
it's um
you just work on the wait a little bit
yes
yeah maybe the shape of the buttons the little absurd take shape silence
domestic and sadness past looks more heavily but uh ten minutes compared to the ultimate bits of less weight
i mean this is plasticine there's only so much you can do it we could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well
that
part of the thing is it will
a lot of people say that they don't like something that's to lie because they don't feel like they have enough control over it
i mean maybe this is excessively happy
i think he needs to have some way he needs to feel like you're still holding something
so that's pretty much it for a presentation actually you're required more than
yeah that's good
thank you are much
so any comments or uh
my prototype uses rule within decided i'd use it
talked about um previous meetings
it all goes to his next phase is the financial
just about to uh
so i'd come back to uh
so evaluation criteria i think uh that would be good
so
let's compute the finance i have some uh calculations which are made uh as further
the budget
so here you can look like uh the energy source and uh hand dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells
uh it's optional somewhat option there and at once the chip-on-print that's what uh we were talking about that
so
then we have sample sensor and flashy speaker
uh maybe a documentary
then special color
i push-button
so uh actual our budget was uh twelve point five euro but uh it's coming to nine point nine five euros so we are and uh below the budget
okay so still saving some money
i think it's a good figure
yes for me
nice
congratulations you know we haven't got the mic yet so
enveloping it does cut the cost one way to market it is it
maybe it's for some money we can utilize for or uh marketing
there say it's okay and uh
which is the pensive already
oh on this
problem
provision or a cost analysis will not have an l. c. display
l. c. display is gonna be very expensive do
but it's not filled in style does it will have the price yeah yeah yeah okay sorry
so if we yeah end up personally to the three year old
oh
oh remote
now are up around about twelve tall and a half
as to what
uh the company
had initially requested
so that means we can put the uh this billions billion
as far as
production uh mind putting above question because we're talking about profit also
uh mine you'll see uh
the problem with uh our survey the the possibility of how many units can be sold what percentage of the market et cetera cetera because at all this has to be taken it
into consideration
uh this is just production cost it is not uh advertising cost it's not transportation cost uh
yes it's still uh we had to one point have will inflate yes
quite a bit
the cost of the cost of the unit
for the company
so to come up with what the company wants is it fifty million
oh
profit
i really like it
this we are talking about one unit okay so then input into the quantity
okay
and the cost will come down
slightly both customization because this is being them in on the on on order basis might be uh that the quantities we won't try the circuit board will be right would be produced in quantity but the cost of the case would uh
and be fixed to the
uh you get some pretty cheap labor they can do this case for one euro
x. files really that's the cost material analytical
that's really
stan
um
but anyway still we are under control okay so what uh i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors will people get uh
the production cost less 'kay so that we can save some money
okay to put in with our marketing more uh we know the promotions whatever
okay
so that uh i would look often i mean speak to the management in computational some more uh
'cause don't
if we can go to to my display
will come back to yours
'cause just to give
everybody an idea of the market
now scare everybody out of this project
yeah
if i'm still here or some person yeah
yeah um well
yeah
for abuse me is going to be trendwatch
it's the same when you do four
shouldn't be
and i'll start right now
yeah
that's not the same when you have to go back and find another one
whatever name
popped up
uh uh functional try functional might not be even normalcy
i'm excited there
yeah that's it so color screen by screen
oh no
since uh we need to have some trouble ideal market uh we had independent status as it does this market has availability um so what we need eight million units per year
okay
our internal company evaluation poster between eighty nine million which is approximately same as independence day
um so if we continue
and look at the findings
next screen
which means that uh if we have a target of two million with the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year
which is actually a tremendous amount
i'm not keeping
no kidding
uh maybe they already expect so if we put an inflated price of fifty euro or production cost they cannot exceed
twenty five euro okay we're already in debt there
price
okay which is poor
promotion labor because we only include the promotion in the cost
um transport for the material to the stores or whatever our home over break this down between our
our retailers
twenty five percent of the market to get to two million units or two main units we have to have a profit of twenty five euro per unit to get to the fifty million you need your profit
yep
okay
so
obviously remember i just had agreed on the evaluation before
perfect uh fancy stylish and most of the of the you know the ease of use
speech recognition
cost we've gone through these no the company's most evaluated
feasibility to be able to take enough to the market
to justify production
what we project is over two euros
but be that the market changes very very quickly maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months
so you know we have to move a decision
can the company still too lenient
can sell it
for fifty euros could are gonna findings
um
i would uh like to explore the possibility of using an alternative
um delivery in sales channel which would be um to use the internet i was thinking the thing for promotion and ordering and then to drop ship the product to the customer is residents that we have no storage yet no um you do have transportation instead of the labor cost which you don't have the transport to the
a point of saying oh yes yeah point of sale is online
yeah you do a shopping center somewhere
or strategically place shopping centers rather my my my
that's on syntax you should sell through him and signed a bill very well yeah yeah
there's an idea i'm going over there um
to find more fulfilled and upscale technology uh what you are selling yeah yeah
unique products uh
that actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customizable on the web people can look at the different options they have
see maybe what other people have done one the range of possibilities as far as if you're in a store
you can't
unless you're highly imaginative
person and you may not really know what it is you want whereas on the web if you have a bunch of pictures you can serve trigger ideas and
and you can even have a in a movie that you can rotate the object and look at that yeah no i think you're missing really is the the way you wanted to the feel of the product
but
we're getting used to that it's not quite like trying an issue but
people are getting used to buying things on line that they can't touch
the first run down through with watches too you can customize what you can see how it is that's the end of the production you can change it uh
is a lot a long way it is doing this now
your route to look on it and look this way
as possible do this maybe there's a possibility of something more than two million someone you wish
feasibility of feasibility uh
well with the price um
okay
right
and that's uh the only one that uh
okay then uh let's wait for the production okay then uh you can evaluate the product so it looks like technically in the room
uh have you
what turnaround time do we have
'cause any production evaluation and you were very very quick or very rarely so it's it's really great
of course so it will uh come back into weeks
we wouldn't do it
for me whatever you said okay
prototypes you mean
yes there and um more about product evaluation
well should do some market tests uh once we have prototypes and do some borders and things like that in
test market
through another marker for people to do indeed do this you gave them in give you will make some form it's minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use
it's not trivial talk because we are we are not going to do to know all quality okay so we can no no remote we definitely shouldn't do it via attribute
so we go to the other place
and i don't think it's take modern problems done
okay so that's the real production we've installed once we product evaluation
okay been there
it's not moving uh
the technical team and uh
your team
okay
management
in in
uh
okay
any outstanding
so any any other uh questions or uh comments to the
this 'cause
no huh
i think we've very much covered everything
okay so they do have something i just wondering about if we're gonna do product evaluation and what about time for redesign
yeah 've
the users come back and tell us no this is bad this is bad we want this done differently
okay uh
let's take like this let's proceed with this model okay for the for the
market introduction okay so no more changes would be made okay
in this
the basic design
okay
we will introduce this more today and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers then
we can uh go for the
second generation generation
okay
there's not and there's no limit
the problem is that we know is like a generation of the first generation of logs for some silly reason and
get a customer i had a little idea
they'll do more taste
okay so that is annoying
there's no limit
no but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned just to
a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that
we think we'll work but we don't really have anything to bank specific
yeah so that's the reason we are here for uh the design
okay i hope you recognize that right i'm not
everybody i mean the whole point um user evaluation is to see what real people need we have our own motivations in mind we have round ideas in mind but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell
yeah but uh see we oughta take a few consideration so can only the price consideration one of the few two consideration okay like uh you can you tell you can order it more like a need more chilly okay
so it depends on the individual taste
you know so we have yeah hard to balance somewhere
yeah of course i'm just trying to point out that i think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is to
sure well you have no redesign not you personally but
yeah and the product will have i don't know doesn't
redesign time bins
yeah
do you know what season of the year time of the year is the most important for t_v remote control sales
would it be the christmas season by any chance the sports time sports seas
or before which supports all help
cool
so soccer maybe those that you all have been involved occupied it needed to be
to make an remote control
so i think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronize the final though the launch of a user tested device with some special event yeah that's a good idea and then um so that gives us a little more time perhaps than we anticipated because
i don't know when the world cup is but i'm sure there's gonna be one major sport
oh another my major sports event probably not the um the football games coming at the end of january i think that might be a little too aggressive yeah uh but
so i'm just like yeah pointing out uh uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing the press and then to launch
um added a major sports event or uh perhaps two that are still in place to advertise that tivo and to work with motion pictures and there might be some motion picture that are coming out
um that are coming out on d. v. d. that uh they need to have an special remote control to work with it so we could maybe work at a campaign with uh with sony pictures for example maybe some management has got
have relationships there we can average his uh that of course uh i will convince them and to do that
that's great
it's just something to keep in mind is this really really avoid a lot of products have gone out there without being properly user test that are completely flopped when in fact it gets re released a few years down the line that with proper testing and it takes off like crazy
disposable diapers is an example of that in fact anyway he had started using one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years there was a disposable consumer product
and uh
people in the market
hadn't really
gotten onto the concept that you could use something and then throw it away because it wasn't there
but then when they re launched in thirty years later they were virtually the same design but people had gotten a throw away you know paper caps and now get all kinds of things that
hadn't um so yeah you're right timing is very important but i think we've got a good product
yeah the cities and areas here that's right from what uh the brand right here
on the program
it's gonna be very important to the company
you're behind the scene and he's uh friends clean so yeah
he'll be he's three
i don't like it
good luck
a lot
marketer uh
you look very relaxed considering you know the uh
straight
those yeah
okay so then uh let's come to uh closing my salary costs within the budget
and uh is the project evaluated okay so that will uh come so
okay for the without time being so tags for all your efforts and play pool okay in the great design
and uh let's leave it to the add later for once production is
for and the minute i met some folks
so let's meet her uh this evening to handle
close and working
sounds good good thinking nice working with the data
thank you
i think a good quality
right
the pace and the input layer is only used the wrong
oh
um
or what
um
uh huh
hm
