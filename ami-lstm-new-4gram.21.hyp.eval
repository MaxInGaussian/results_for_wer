um
one day or something
yeah
huh
oh
okay
so this yeah
and uh
uh yeah it
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay good morning everybody would like you know come back at least to start this team
um i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us for kickoff meeting
my name is rose longer and i'll be the project manager
um our agenda is we're gonna do a little opening and then um we'll talk little bit about the project both into acquaintance legislation which are little bit including the tool training exercise
i'm going with into the project plan to a little discussion
and clusters we only have twenty five minutes
first of all our project eighty um we're creating a new remote control which we have three calls about it needs to be original trendy and user friendly
i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those
um so we're gonna divided up into three
and compacting hertz
first the functional design which will be
um for so do individual work on to meeting the conceptual design individual work and a meeting
and then the detailed design individual work and a meeting
so that would need to be doing our own ideas coming together
um
collaborating
okay we're gonna get to know each other little bit
so um what we're gonna do start out there
yeah
let's start off with the mean um
um lima sorry only men
um we're gonna do a little tool training so we're gonna work out whiteboard behind it uh
introduce yourself um say one thing about yourself and then drive favorite animal and tell us about it
okay
uh in
you know which one of these like between britney
probably not
alright solve this is to try everything what have you guys have whatsoever
but uh see introduce myself anyways okay
okay
uh
so
well stated made me less doing actual studies
oh well i'm happy artistic talents
how you spell your name
okay
yeah
b.
oh and i guess i'm the industrial designer
right
so see if i can get
uh
okay
well uh
terrible
uh
this is a this is jane has a variable it is
well
i think there
joe
pre relational government-run
noise
yeah
yeah
so what are your favorite characteristics
uh i i like having to show today
um
it's
quite cool area or around where you got um
quite decorative all animals they can so they can
they're very adaptable
they carry everything i mean without
um
i mean there is a job
actually
so you just go round table
like our whole lives in uh
uh don't be user interface design
project
um
oh yes
trying to my uh
oh i should develop the evaluation original because it might be nice to have martin c. nine
um
no commercial
what's this
the results are displayed as well
somewhere around
is the world to see the man was gonna go to the
uh the other is like well this is 'cause uh
the
well first required televisions
also the
the canisters
we don't really know much about
those those
the work
rooms
they just go
uh
oh
hi caption
um
alright unjustly i um
around easier started off
yeah yeah
i wasn't actually uh
i see this sort of field and
variable
yeah
really wow
oh
just
yeah
you know why
how
uh s. in the nineteen uh
i know yeah however
and
who who might go
p. make supposed to use the l.
he no matter what uh i like uh we uh
uh they uh they laid spread
every time
okay yeah
try to pretend that we can do about that
uh
yeah
yeah
okay i rose to my intention manager
from california
i mean
which
but
see
it's definitely significantly harder when you're doing it okay
i was actually area
the same way
that's a passenger
which is out
and listen to you
yeah
both
i agree
uh
okay
yes
i uh
and the red cross you notice a sea captain in chinese
all the time
so i really enjoyed it
i'm just thinking and i really beautiful animals too
okay um okay moving on to
slightly more serious
i could talk about project finances
um we have all the
we'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro and with the profit aim of
um
fifty million euro um for our sales and because this is such this is for television that's the with market range of internet like it's an international market range we don't have to worry about specifics
um
in order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve
fifty years ago
so we're selling it for twice
what we'd like to use it for
okay um
just to generate over the discussion about the project um could i'd like to hear about your experiences using wrote remote controls
um be first ideas about um creating any
no control
what would be the best
um where you what are the features that you really like what features that you don't like
et cetera
seven
oh i hate when there's like
for every button that you have to pass to uh actually turn on the t_v like you have to do one for the power the t_v and then like
another one to get the actual screen and then make ask about going in and out now they keep combining
all different
remotes together and i don't know if i
necessarily like lexical item end up
the multi media overload and just one last the t_v um
we get past some sort of like
device to help you find it
and have used of user remote controls things like
t_v you see do you play uh
it's a video recorder
uh it's
i guess the the pretty neat little tools that you don't have to get up and walk across to the to change the channel
so especially if you're someone really lazy like me then
pretty nice
um
i find them there can be a bit annoying
especially
like you know if i'm watching t_v i have
after three separate remote controls have informed via one from the t_v one for the digital box
one for the video recorded as well
um
and also they tend to
i tend to be a bit confusing to put too many buttons on them
oh
uh
to to sort of
to sort of complicated splendid
what i really want to do is switch on and off to change the channel changeable
yeah um
i agree with
having too many remotes around my dad has a whole bunch more at home of remotes for various things that i don't know how to work out for them
um
the what's important for me i guess is that it's easy to use
and
that there's not too many buttons are not too small you know
yeah you need to and to know what you're doing
and one thing i particular like is
if you're not um script moving it around to get it to work on infrared yeah um i think there's a way around that
but i know in my residence right now the
the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get into non so it's just simpler
just to just turn on the t_v itself and i think that's
if you're gonna make a remote control it should actually work for what it's doing
and about like batteries and things like that because there's some amount of the job
i don't require
i think batteries or do a remote and her batteries
um how dimensional than that we could
but possibly could use like a lithium battery uh i guess that would last a lot longer than double a is on like that doesn't batteries are used in a lot of um between players analogously hm
uh
oh it's it's a little bit of conflict over um
yeah combining all the remotes could together versus having
by different remotes
so um
like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote and yeah you don't wanna have five remotes
so how do we work with that
could we get something that
just has
no it doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or
program this other things that are not
pre coherent about
but that just has your major buttons
for that work for everything you know volume control the on off
channel changing
maybe that's specially divides it so it's like you look if you're trying to get the t_v on that's not the topic on the remote and nobody would be vertical original
in terms of how we're gonna make it but it's like all the t_v service here than all p. c. as it was here all the
whatever else you programmed into it job just yet separate place and not like all the on button together to know like i don't even know what i'm turning on the yeah
and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes
yeah
that you wouldn't need to use every day
um
okay so maybe have like one remote that as the main functions on off channel changing volume another right remote with all the special things is that is one thing that on remotes tend to have buttons that the t_v still longer have as well um so like you have to have been some workers you don't need a special functions occasionally
um
but
i'm still a hundred wouldn't a normal remote
can the school read
designing a remote control for television only
good question
i live
the first devices just to be used for the television
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder function to
i don't know that you should just look to
just looked at every television
television related buttons on
it's a good question um
i'll look into it
let me think it's just t_v mean like that
for yeah
just write that
your project and your television remote control
it's not like it
but then saying
yeah
now things might be more advanced madness
so we should
with you should assume it to them
it's just a television remote control
well over
we'll suppose that would be the most of of
well you record stop buttons or with the do the group as well
i don't know if it works
technological
yes i guess you have to define what
what we're aiming for
if it's just a television in there
it's a bit simpler continuous buttons that would even need to be on it
the
estimate the bands being red ball and
large
if you have older people or people like me that are very coordinated hand i
it's really quite important that you're not pressing a small
i t. mobile phone sized buttons
if we can help it
okay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas man if we move on
i couldn't do we
um
now next meeting starts in the units
they've actually been only working on this
this one for about twenty
so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um
but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually um the industrial design only men who are doing um
the working design
um
the user interface designer that's really interesting
technical functions i guess like keeping in mind the buttons then size the buttons
i'm user requirements
um
so do we hear metaphor trends um about different things that people need
um
i guess kind of the same discussion that we've been having moved from actual concerned consumers
okay um
and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach i realized in the past when we we didn't have much we just wanted to go brainstorming done um
so
very excited to see all your animals
and how old what wonderful um artist sailor
good
oh
any questions
what we're gonna be discussing the next meeting
you know
i haven't gotten an agenda yet um i'll put that together
i'm sure as will each get our own instruction and then um because what we're gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together
not so
sure well have more concrete things to contribute next time
she will be busy
okay um
whatever p. make minutes and probably members channel audio
oh just included on that
things that we talked about
your email your slides as well
because
yes i please
think again
i'll just attach it to you know
in your
your number two nine two three
for a corrected
right
which is like an idiot
yeah
yeah
it
make sure you keep checking company website emails
the big screen
i just see this oh oh you can just save as and save it in my documents
or just file yeah and using s.
kind and i got you a study
yeah and save it in
i see
twenty five percent reasons just write a semester just seem to be even less house
yeah
okay
right
yeah
yeah
um
yeah
okay
okay
see you all again
this is a functional design meeting
who
just in time
okay
yeah
okay
um we put the fashion in electronics
let's start
we our agenda today um
just to tell you this
two
um
when we do an opening talk about um did you get the minutes i emailed them to you i'm also putting in them in the shared folder so
yeah that's very general objectives and have your three presentations
um i'll talk about the new project requirements are just received
and then we have to make a decision on a remote control functions
finally what was close
we send this meeting at actually twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes so
press what the functional design objectives
um we need to keep in mind the user requirements specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled
the textual functions design what effect the apparatus should have
and the working design
how the apparatus actually works to fulfill its function
okay two presentations um
lingo it is you want to choose
um
should we go in or you just did it
joint please do
um
on the record
uh
yeah
kitty
you might have to use the answers
oh
right
in some way
including v_t_s
somehow
uh not so small and uh
yeah
oh i see yeah
um
i have to press function
sections and yeah
comes in the room
h_m_ms thing
is applied to the way in your scrutiny
count rates burden
i think each other pushing really hard
and so
oh okay
okay
huh huh
economic
no
in terms thirteen million right
they get
i
so you and our viewers are able to get access to um the report that it's online or from the only one with this
yeah
right
you know how to clean out of
oh
press the little presentation it then
um political why kind of their above job
that
yeah right
source and talk alone about
functional requirements uh people specify when the rasta
um i guess real reaction did market research they had a hundred subjects and their usability lab
and they watched um much t_v and recorded the frequency that they use particular buttons and the relevant that those buttons had
what they found was they analyze people's desires and needs
focusing on their desires
um people specifically said that
he thought remotes were ugly seventy five percent of the a hundred subjects
noted that and that they are more importantly they'll eighty percent said that they would be willing to pay more
for fancier looking remote i don't know anything beyond what feinstein's but
that's particularly used us i think
um also
he did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inverse the related to each so younger people were more inclined to uh
want something with voice recognition whereas the older people in uh six sixty and above the segmenter so
did i really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition
um people also had certain frustrations that i think that we could try to take into consideration
with
our design that being people
um frustrated with losing their remotes
i think over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration
you're also frustrated with the difficulty it is
to learn how to use a remote
and i think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons it just needs to be easy to use
it also mention something called r. s. i. announce hoping someone might you will inform me as to what are excited because i don't manage to injury
but
the buttons are still energy uh
there we go well close enough like that so i guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing people do not like that um the repetitive use i guess
cost a string
um looking at the needs people
specify
how right now is that people's remote are not matching the operating behavior up people are only
using ten percent of the buttons
that they have offered to them on their remote
and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume people also zap like change the channel
about um sixty five percent
during our views
so we really need to focus in on those volumes
and channel-changer is rather then things like the audio settings and screen settings and channel settings because there used much more frequently in college complicate
what's going on
so i think that something that you might want to think about
the idea of an l. c. d. screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on
a people's preferences on that were so i don't know if that's coming to me later as like that but something for us to consider are also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use
make sure that you know something like
no audio settings
is it is given as much importance in visibility on the remote a similar channel changing that's used a lot more often
and basically in order for us to went over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly
and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it certainly give them any
hand injuries or
things like that
yeah
thank you very much so as i was great
um
let's move on to the next presentation
um on effects
yeah
three
i see
yeah i was gonna do
he stated
yes right
yeah
we
it's
who
and i think that's in the shared generate anyone wants to look at it
definitely
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
alright so i'm gonna talk about will be technical technical functions design of the remote control
um
you need to start by considering what a remote control actually is it's uh
a device that allows us to
did you certain effects on the television
so it's basically a communication device we
which are the remote control what we want to do it sends a message to a television site
change channel change volume
uh
yeah i just these settings are just about this
um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control
first thing to do is to come up with a design specifications
we need to know what our final product is gonna be like so we need uh a clever idea of
exactly what this product does
uh how it works and what the end user is gonna want from this product
um
uh away i suggest that we could go about this this by
designing uh somewhat different prototypes of user interfaces for this product
um and then
i'm trying to get some feedback
uh about
uh how well these particular prototypes work
uh so find out
what people think about
um using a remote control is is quite subjective experience
um
then different different people sort of prefer different things
um we should remember but
remote controls are uh are fairly standard basic requirements when the users using a remote control
he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places so in some sense we can do it
we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
uh so that we're not completely shocking people
but
i think we'll end up there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh
and just to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different something that stands out
um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities
uh the first of these is this technological uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is
the second is is economic uh we need to find a balance between features and vice as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add device
uh but it would also include the design of the product yeah
anyway
so i had a look on uh on the web uh to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls
in analyzing these we can consider uh
what what things what's good about them uh what things like it by what's bad about them what's wrong with them
um how we can improve on the design still the diphones and
what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls
his two examples uh
probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum um
on the left to we've got uh
and engineering based design for a remote control so it's one that's got lots of buttons it's it's fully featured
everything you might possibly want to do is a you know it's got four by puts up down channel numbers volume uh freeze frame
yeah it's it's fully featured and
yeah it might take a while to get to learn to use it but once you've learned that speaking you can do whatever you want with your t_v
one on the right is a lot more basic it's just got the essential functions of the t_v changing the channel play stop volume
it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it but
again
it's it's wings amount about still disadvantages you can't use it
save to it
two threes television picture uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control
so we got to
to find out
find a way of striking a balance between the two
um
as i said before remote controls are subjective
different people want different things
um personally well what i want from a remote control is a device that simple it it's easy to use uh it's got bigger buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel
it it does everything that i needed to uh as i said before quite lazy i don't walk across the room just to adjust my television
another one something that that looks cool um but um the truth feels good for its ergonomically designed
okay thank you very much
this
pretty soon
it's funny to
see them in
drastic difference between those two remotes
yeah
and i thought were very pretty um
i think that could be a selling point
yeah evaluation
yes yeah thanks to assign a market technology that looks cool yeah yeah i guess that's why companies don't happen
no
progress
i i really can't see button to self esteem
even there it is
i
sure
already
and so we did a bunch of montana is that just about it but you
so uh that was just on the handwritten because thing
you know when we grew up to be beautiful
uh i um
now how do i play again
um there is right about wrong
there are three delete if its weight button
and there are three icons in the one that looks like it that's get them
right okay
so this is a working design presentation um i had a bit of some issues with this
because
i was able to find everything i needed but i guess that's the were still in early stages
um
so yeah this is this though with
the thing about working design is the
what we're trying to do is working designers figure out how the operator apparatus can fulfill its function
um
one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder
it works because it converts that electrical energy to grinding the beans
and then you put the beam through a filter
and that filter so
and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of
electrical energy and then other things that are brought in to make it work
i don't know if i'm explaining that very well but like it to us
so the method that it's
um working designers to figure out what you need to make it fulfill this practical function
what what needs to be done and how do we convert all means to make that time
so
well the easiest thing to do is to break down
all the points
at which you need something to happen
to make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted
true towards 'cause practical function
then i think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately
so
um
when you press the edges that
so the findings that i got uh very just very briefly is that
you have a choice
of
the way that the
information is projected to the receiver and
in my opinion the infrared is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sideline
so that's why they are gonna work on
um the user interface is critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip
that controls that converts the electrical energy into data
which then goes through the infrared so
there is the chip uh uh i think ian is designing is gonna be
cur show
and really it all comes down to the to the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design
so the components that we find here are the energy source you know the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work then the chip
which converts the data the user that's controlling the chip and the infrared bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver
yeah four main components
and
they
our designs are sort of like this you have your energy source right there
which
then
um
brings
energy or information to the chip
which
is also controlled by the users you have
energy going to the user who is controlling the chapel
number one is true
uh
uh
um you use that thing on the you can go
yeah
previous previous
sorry about that
pardon
oh
no no no no
okay okay let's just get back to my schematic here
double
with the right with the lieutenant who yeah
i think it's a person
here
to mention that
if you do
there we are you sorry
as i'm kind of pathetic things like this
um
alright
so you have your energy source your user interface for controlling the chip
the chip also uses the energy
and the chip
through the use of the user interface is gonna control switch which will work your infrared bulb
which will then bring the data to the receiver
so hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of gambled away
this is the
the parts of the working design they need to be figured out
and
personal preferences besides the fact that i can't spell we need a long lasting energy source people don't want to be changing it a lot
we need a chip
that works well with the user interface that isn't too complicated
yeah straightforward interface likely unless saying simple not
overwhelming it with
information and we need a reliable and clear infrared signal
so that you're not leaving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hand
that's pretty much it for the working design
the next groups
and just
okay
entity
he he yes absolutely
oh
yeah
yeah
okay
a given told we two threes yeah
f. t. v. c. ready to be really
yeah
i don't know
except
lefty lucy regulatory
right
note that we need to improve in this
yeah
um
figure out every time
yeah
it is a good deal
oh
oh
okay
moving nothing on my screen
who we are
well you see yeah that's
okay requirements we have a couple new requirements i'll just e-mail right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in minors or craziness
we bring it up get around on the meetings are far but
we're not gonna work with teletext because um
but it that's been taken over by the entrance we're not gonna worry about um
not to worry about that months topics files
um
it's a british thing
oh you don't notice it no no depending which can explain it
oh
you know it's like uh
spans kind of similar to very very basic web browser um
you have
my enough uh numbers in your remote control
um already
and you type in the page number you want
so like you type a hundred on your remote control um this this kind of
index pens
on the television screen just in some text and some very broke it can graphics on that
and you just type numbers to go to different pages and pitch information oh mostly rather boring stuff like what's on t_v next and
prices
lottery numbers and sports cause you
useful but if you see the t_v saying like go to page one sixty antsy facts now that's what they're talking about
so it's pretty all technologies
he wanted to cry explains why i have no idea why we don't have
i get it
you still
okay um well we're not going there
them and decided we're not gonna work with that
um
okay um and we also get the like your question earlier on whether there's going to be to for television video or et cetera just for television
that our tax time
um otherwise becomes too complex or wanna get this out um very quickly
we'll never
short amount of time
um and finally this one marketing i think um our corporate image has to be recognizable
so while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use a color and our slogan in the in the new design
so what's our corporate image like is this kind of yellow color which uh
quickly put the functional emailing asking we have that the emphasis on the horrors in switchboard and wall
you
but it's here we put the
um
passionately
electronic certificate that in that in mind
so we want something that looks good
yeah
it and is yellow
yeah or it had that maybe some buttons could be yellow like we can we can play around with a little bit
um
okay we need to talk about our functions and our target group
we decide who our target group is your um your analysis of different market um of the marketing you identified that different groups one and different things or had certain preferences for example that um
yeah older people didn't really care for um voice recognition my younger people dead
um
and so
who are reading this that
if we're gonna say that function uh fashion we put the fashion in electronics then you
automatically i think
the younger group
that that was gonna be attracted to this
yes i think was gonna have the money to buy it
task
you know
it's gonna be twenty five euro remember so um
it has to be dealt marketable to um
whoever it is
yeah
is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes with the television because that would affect the way that we market
well he's right now what we're doing is um deciding on
just the remote itself
so it will probably be sold separately
right okay twenty five
you're by itself
the only breeds on i was given in terms of age was the voice activation um basically there's a big jump
after thirty five so people don't really care pathway so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five there
yeah i think that that's a good idea i dunno maybe given any other numbers working um in terms of each later but
if that's sort of the only quality that we have that
it's a by and age and we would wanna stick between fifty and thirty five range
that's probably uh population quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway so
you might be a fairly good target group for us
now those are that's old specific for speech recognition are we gonna use that as one of our functions
um
um
i i would say no because it's gonna too much lower price
especially if we are marketing it as a selling product people are gonna be playing
uh
but god we've got a price limit of
was it twelve twelve and half euros interpretive situated easiest and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into button you twelve and a half euros without having to make too many over compromises
what also we're gonna put i mean not that i'm really going how about it i don't know what else you can
put in a remote to make it technologically advanced uh so like other than just me yeah look out how is it i mean it can you look really great and some of the thing up and um buttons um i don't know when gonna buy a new remote
well why are we
why are we aiming for technological advancement everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean um
more technology like they could use in mind you could
i mean
not
if
they might be overwhelmed with
with the remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology
someone's looking to buy a new remote don't they want like an upgrade and am now
i've created a well we can look for look and look at greater we can locate um user-friendly
yeah simplification
they could have across the remote thinking whether t_v that's just
in-house bunnies
or maybe a pair quiet maybe they're just missing it
uh
and we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have
get a very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or you might do i think it's a complicated uh
we should semantics there like if there's just the simple either that's where this way that had like the mean months and then you can pull something out kind of it might be that the rest of the buttons but there are something like when
did you say about the logo controls look
like some t_vs they have a sort of
uh sliding screen on the remote control but no it's all the complicated buttons who so if you wanna do something complicated slide
program your television or which units and you
you open up the slope or show slow speed on those who spectrum buttons and like people who don't wanna ever look at that and never even have to speak um and if you get the instruction manual icons of the and you just don't even reading on never even know that those things can pull out you know you're happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes one as the easy ones among us
not not will get once it's all still on monday
um we have to be careful that that that does in p_h_d um chip transmitting information
yeah
but um that's gonna be
mostly technologically
um
okay um so what what are we emphasizing
right when in this city
simplicity and functions and simplicity and fashion
okay those are very good goals i think um that we have to keep in mind it with everything we do
simplicity fashion and
or usability d_s_ps
um
how do you wanna say that which includes on an emphasis on making the infrared very functional h_m_m and you don't have to travel around a lot
yeah
what can you do there
make the infrared more functional why would it not be
something i think it's a lot like to do with battery
but that's just my the battery and that i think that the chip
takes the data and presents it while without sort of scattering
yeah
so just the quality of the chat
yeah
i think so
um
the quality the quality of all the components really mean
we can't really do anything
shine work like this
can be visible down the line
so our target group
we're saying fifteen to thirty five
well i don't know i use with numbers if we're not doing this
voice recognition yeah which i kind of i kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control um uh like it might be necessary for a t_v enough for the kids because bluetooth is pretty hard to
yeah yeah and it might be too expensive
i have the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you low weight like you need it like you would you you just talk to to
yeah probably
ultimately lazy people
i'm not going to do with predictive remote
yeah
yeah
maybe i mean if i get more numbers i'll email you before the next meeting in terms of each of those
but this doesn't divide up anything and it was only a hundred subjects also to which isn't
i mean
really is not representative especially that hundreds up to date and can subdivide into each group that means that very few in each each group so
and then
regardless where you're aiming for the under sixty five or something
under sixty five okay that's a good start
um
i'd say where it um i can we narrowed it down to maybe a um
teenagers and families
'cause that would go on to like fifty nationals or something
do you like fifty uh
oh
it's it's hard to scenario figure out right now
i think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of really easy i mean we we said simplicity is is one of the features so it's going to
appeal to people
maybe people have problems with technology you know people will get is had by having lots of buttons and i might be older people
but then we've also got function which is something that definitely appeals to younger people
i mean we don't about define a target group by the demographic of each and we define it by like the demographic um
like conduct how much money they have to spend or something like that basically what is the has these available in the television
to like always have a bottle like that sort of thing
um
so maybe it's more useful to just to just find objectives like fashion is implicitly been defined specific
target group
as far as ages
because yeah things all different will appeal to different people
okay
um well there're couple functions
do we want some books that do we want
some kind of the thing to find it if it's lost
um like a button on the t_v and press enter right or something i don't know like a beep
i mean i guess over four fifty percent um of the fact that frustration from from have that was the biggest one and
people's that that happened to me i mentioned it before we knew about it
and if we're talking about making me e. z. that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing uh
sort of a day and would be relevant like the overall calling band yes no
pretty good
okay we have to uh we have about four minutes left to define our functions so let's do that quickly
until we want something to keep it from getting lost
yeah
and
wind
um
we want large buttons for the essential things
yeah
yeah large accessible buttons with the essentials
we want a possibility to um to get
um
possibility to guide uh extra functions
um
yeah but
which are kind of hidden away in some way
oh no he didn't but uh
but not as prominent as the main features
um
um yeah
anyway
and we also will
we want it to be fashionable
which i'm not sure about the functions so much as a
uh huh
yeah
slow anything on the coffee table it's not like names or anything
yeah
okay do it any other essential functions that we need
battery
do we had a long life battery guys
yeah man that goes with simplicity and ease of use really
well things never happen to read about yeah
we should maybe investigate properties about
true to
i suspect that
were controlled with with the book
yeah i would imagine that just 'cause it is an electronic device that come in
i think it does i don't i don't think about way operated chip and convert that much data with though
the one with element but you will maybe have a little tracking station like a mobile phone
really cool cradle for your ipod
yeah those as possible
okay maybe do that instead
so you don't and you are like a rechargeable battery
but know that might contribute to less people losing it too if you do that
stays one phase
um
and to think about um space and living rooms to like
yeah 'cause them i mean would you put on the t_v or not
stick okay that's a that's a good idea will keep it
yeah that's a self number yeah
with the phone
okay
um
yeah we're gonna conclude now what does everyone said
the functions um okay
um after the meeting we're gonna key to complete disks um questions summarize the summary
no word summarization
um and then we'll have a lunch break
after that we have thirty minutes of individual work
um how much of a problem minutes in the project documentation is included with powerpoint slides everyone can do that as well but the great
um each individual actions applying
um
i d. industrial design if you components concept
user interface the user interface concept
i get trend were watching
and as
as last time you get specific you had instructions from your personal coach emailed to you
and hopefully i hope next so you'll be able to access more of the website that they seem to tell you that you could
yeah it's been frustrating that
um
sure to note any frustrations or any um
issues that come up in here um
he knew her
um
summaries
okay
sounds good
tree-view
it is enough to
it it
did you um we will look like for years and are good for
yes i just did that
hopefully it is dead people
yep
yeah
looks like there are um
looks like the second one kind of of mine
it's that that i do it's from like an earlier project i think so
okay
um
whereas about
here comes under the shared folder under it might not even be new so in there we have a technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements
always
yeah i only have three i just have occurred for yeah
yeah that's what i have as well as so
you don't have might
no but that's good i think you're in the email
separately gets uh server
it's
just yeah
um
but development and then say the
probably there
arena and you can't see it
okay
well figure that out in the meantime
okay i ram
okay
um
yes
okay go actually small dimensions
i'm gonna try it this also
so while i was
i just
what kinds of
screen
if you had a function f. eight again it's has the same cost so
first i mean it
does this second time viewed again
it'll turn it off here
computer
and i know there any of your news can be fine
if you do it again
it'll go back to just being on your computer
and then at a time until the above so if you can't
if you had any ties to scale factor
i again
okay
yeah
yeah
fourteen months
at least you know how we can um
so conceptual design meeting
uh did started approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again
i'm so we'll go just after three o'clock
um
okay
our agenda we're gonna do it opening and with it a review of the minutes of the last meeting then we'll have your three presentations
um and then we have to make a decision on the remote control concepts
final close
opening
are these are minutes from the functional design
we side our target group it is that hackers on who can afford it because we have international appeal um said it's for all age groups different um functions of that
i mean objectives for simplicity and fashion
and um in specific functions or something to keep the remote from getting lost
large buttons for the essential functions
a possibility for extra functions like a sliding
deciding piece
and a long life battery or charging station
okay now three presentations i'd like to do it in this order first to the conceptual specification of components properties and materials
could be
um and the conceptual specification of user interface
and then the trend watching
alright
oh
hm
function f. eight it
okay
right
oh
um i'm very excited by
this one actually guys i had a lot of fun
doing it components design
this is where you do have cats
what does it take to make a remote control and watching me make our specific remote control about uh
um
so we need to examine each element separately but we're designing a full thing so you want to keep it integrated as a whole
the main elements of remote controls in general and therefore as as well uh the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip
and the battery
these are all things that we had sort of addressed before but
you take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made as in what they should look like
the case uh the options that i got from headquarters about what we can do um there's there's shape
uh the case we could do a flash a flat case the curved case or maybe even a double double curved case
i haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yeah just keep that in mind that these are the options that we have for manufacturing
and we can make a case out of
plastic than the main base would be plastic but we have all these sort of fashion
in technological elements we can hand in the word latex titanium rubber or other colors types of plastic
that would be a case
um buttons the buttons we have um
push-buttons which is what
real reaction uses the most often but we also have the scroll scroll wheels which can have integrated push-buttons for we could go all high-tech and have an l. l. c. d. screen
um circuit board in chip we could have the simple one regular one or an advanced one depending on what our other needs are
and then the boundary i think is where things get most exciting we're talking about long life batteries here and here we can have your sort of basic double a batteries but we also have these options of um
using the kinetic battery like are used in high tech watches where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up
um so simple movements like pushing buttons with recharge the battery
or solar battery although there are slight
um
complications with solar batteries as and we can't use a latex case
if we have a solar battery
or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in there
torches from about fifty years ago flashlights
not quite sure what that is but that's a description that i receive so that's what i passing on to you
so those are options
um
the personal preferences that i was thinking
true
here's what
we've been talking about all through fashion and simplicity
so if we're going for fashion in our cases i think that what we're gonna wanna look at is
a curved or double curved case
probably with a variety of design elements maybe titanium maybe some what we're gonna have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual materials
that's sort of what i have in mind and we wanna go for simplicity
probably push-buttons but i'm sure i'm intrigued by the idea of the scroll
scroll wheel if anyone has anything
any ideas on that i mean i know the ipods and things right now have touch scroll
um
buttons which are exactly like what they're describing so that might be something we wanna look into
and i'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery
a solar i don't think would be such a good idea because how often
are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light
but this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and a simple machine around and make it work
i think that that would be a very interesting thing
but
i think we also want to go for a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down um we really only need a regular advanced chip if we're gonna start using an l. c. d.
so i think we want
to be aware of not making things bold really
technological if they don't need to because that'll keep our manufacturing price way down
that's what i have for options um i appreciate anyone's important but that's what i'm seeing for the future of the
the look of this thing
it's double curved like would that be like to him it's kind of thing
i'm not sure i haven't received any specific
visual so imagine like
double curved is like
you know to so that
curses and i'm sort of over just be like
a single were college come with yeah and now i'm not sure but i'll let you know as soon as i get any pictures
um
yeah would you
i know if we do have a double curved case it can't have any titanium in it
but the titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space program
so that could be quite interesting space age mode
yeah
it's just all things say just read marketing into the element
that's that's all i have to do ads
i hope i didn't go through that too quickly
i'm just a broker question um
the weight of these different elements
and you know what i do know idea
um
i'm assuming
that's
a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight you and that at to titanium is very like i know who but it is uses that's really basic
me
that's all i have gotten so far too
oh
any other questions
i think so yeah
we can save this in the uh shared projects if anyone wants to look the thing that has considerable notes on the topic as well if anyone needs any more information
um
um if you may do it yourself you can put those on her um
and to me there
oh i knew both in a way but if anyone has a specific questions don't hesitate to email me or something
right
because like
you know where um concepts concepts of user interface
um
animals and so much time in the thing
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
right
okay
pages
yeah
uh so i'm gonna there's gonna be
the concept of the user interface listed device
um we've talked about this uh
the two essential properties of the user interface we want it to be simple
and we want it to be fashionable
um
uh
we've also got to remember that this is the device itself is useful purpose uh remote people to be able to use it as a remote control
so we need to determine what the essential functions but
of the device uh and make sure but
which includes
so we've included all the various things that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people
we have a number of different choices for a design construct
um and start start something that there are actually some examples off
um
but
essentially we need to choose
how how is this device going to work how how
what kind of model for this are going to be for user interaction with this device
oh once we've chosen the uh uh concept for its we can um
design the features of and the concepts making sure that we get
will be essential functions in the device and ones
uh the extra functions uh the more advanced features
and of course we also have to make it look cool
so basically that's what we don't want
we don't want lots of buttons or complicated features we want something that looks nice and simple
is there a fairly simple device this is anything like point from apple um
i think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons it's very minimalist tickets design
uh uses four buttons too
to move around a range of settings on the small l. c. d. screen
um
the figure i like about this is it
it's very very quick
to access the main features i could just about make up
uh but it's the bottom three buttons are uh
uh previous track next track play pause
but the main
the main features of you about the things you use all over time
um
but if you want to do anything more advanced you don't have a little menu on the l. c. d. screen and use the buttons just to scroll around and find the more advanced features what
so i think that's that's a good
i could kind of model that we could have
um
is there another example this is uh
it's an interesting idea and see i think it it looks pretty cool
um it's certainly got novelty value
uh it's nice and colorful it's nice invites
uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around the buttons or a different shapes and then you can sort of
yeah if you're watching t_v in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons which
and basically yeah it's it it's fun
so i i like i like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often
so it needs
a few buttons to select your favorite channels i mean most people when they watch t_v
if i have two hundred fifty channels on the t_v and i watch it
for for the west
so you don't buttons for your favorite channel changing the volume which is something you do over time when you're watching t_v
and the button to switch it off because you get bored
um the other features things like adjusting the brightness tune in the t_v
uh
i don't know how else you do have a t_v
um
but these are
these are all necessary function is uh you can't have it
there's no point having a television but you can't you know you can't see the contrast
so we need to find a way of including the somehow
um i think one of the suggestions of make is to him
is to include them in the menu system a bit like on the ipod
so we would even have a small l. c. d. display on the device itself
or uh have a just a menu display that comes up on your television set can be controlled through the device under the light to access access the advanced features
uh it was keeping a very small and simple set of buttons
for all the features that you use most often
okay so you'd be advocating an l. c. d. then
i don't
that's one way to go yes
yeah i mean the the advantages and disadvantages if you
if you have an l. c. d. display it's it's nice because it's
it lets you just sit down and then control your television for your lunch or anything
dot disadvantages and and l. c. d. display would have to be quite yeah 'cause with
right with
or
what would i assume we're gonna be making quite a device
um
it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting is it because it depends watch t_v in the dark yeah you need to be able to see how the the l. c. d. display
the alternative is to have uh
and all screen display on your television but you control any control
a bit like a bit like a they have these um digital boxes where you you press buttons and he comes up with you
this thing of or short words on each channel i mean not that's also a good idea
it can it does have its problems as well if you've got a small t. v. and you're sitting on the other side we started with teletext comes out
hm
uh but that's a that's a design
decision that we can make
i do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seen and then you can see what's going on
um
and so
like favorite channels is is applicable but i think that you do need to have some kind of function work
it's
um you have to you can see the title of the show or possibly description of it i don't like i know i using it as a performer he was saying well if it if it was a lot else d. on the on the remote i don't know that you could think that you'd be able to see it i think we're talking menu
like
contrast and color tuning maybe see or something if i understood you
yeah there are the dominance of one source yes
okay
but it is just some experiment minus than if we put the display on the remote control
good uh communication is one way sorry
you can't have a television send information back to work to look at least i don't think you can
yeah
yeah
oh okay
no language market
okay
yeah
oh
okay okay
um d_c oh well
function to mark
oh yeah
one
right
whatever
if you press five eight
just pass them all
uh-huh
well then i'll have this can be
anything so
i think
um those number two
oh really
okay
yeah
okay so we're gonna look a little bit trend watching
is the u_s getting um an executive summary that was
uh mark investigation and remote controls that was recently conducted
and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan who comments on some things that are gonna be going on this year
so first um they have people being rained on the important aspects of the remote controls
and right now they're saying that currently there is a functional look-and-feel
preference but that believe over the next year it's that's gonna be switching to uh
fancy look-and-feel remotes that just goes back to uh
the whole desire uh for our real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and
so even though we're stressing more shockingly morgan talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea uh
they're sort of money has to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look-and-feel and as these are brains
the top one is a double important to the second one which is doubly important to the third one so
just to take that weight into account
the second thing that was mentioned as important was that technological innovation that would be like if we use something like this piece material uh
l. c. d. screen things like that and then easy to use was the third most important but so
really matter what we need to focus the most on fancy look-and-feel according to the us
i'm not sure okay
yeah hand
option march
talks about that this year's type transfer close issues are pretty cheap
it is it's
yeah
that there's a preference varies by t_v
type material
and so that brings us to my first the fact is
who wants a spongy remote for what you are not sure about
yeah
i think that i
one thing that's gonna go on
at work goes stale this use the phone
um in a year or so
even though this is coming from as a as you know trendwatch market research
i don't know how much have we left there really
wanna take away also considering that the research has been carried out by real reaction i'm a little
hesitant as to uh
like
how these questions may have been worded if necessarily peaceful fashion into technology even if ease of use is necessarily the right drinking
personally like i might reverse it but
if we're working for this company i guess no matter what we have to stress fashion models
is necessarily need to be a spongy material
yeah but there's all kinds of school for education in that window
yeah
have a lot of notes to share if you want then that pretty much some of the of
so we have
he really
see questions for the
yeah uh we can i
possibly combining them
um do you have any ideas had a
possibly use these
um at how to use a fruit vegetable around
or the spongy material at all
okay
could we make is like could we make a spongy remote it would be easier titanium tasks
if it's latex e. it's kind of
i'm really going to have to find a way to protect like the chip an alarm
in in
i my understanding of a latex cases that it's in fact hard to project
step inside but it's covered with the latex which is spongy and soft or on your hands
it's there's something to be said i mean we we got that
i mean earlier from you about um not wanting it to
our our repetitive stress injury to um beings in in
yeah yeah so something instead of it'll be yeah great and then you want a great memory then like easy sinking into this yet i think and envisioning more like yeah
you know the material that you have when you said that like a bicycle really doesn't hurt
yeah you have one hundred i'm imagining that sort of thing and i but uh i think it's gone
given the list of materials uh this forwarded it that seems doable
could we go into fruit and vegetable colors you could color greenish or maybe like
um
couple main ones being like and alignments are striving
it
the the buttons could be feeding that way
who is supposed to be shift work approach
yeah
i don't like the characters and
works great period shays big link areas that
converting the buttons could be set large button that's less again yeah
what is it like a round remote instead of like a veritable up and down on like problems but it's right
kinds of
she for
yeah
yeah
like i don't know but i think you'll be able to hold it 'cause i think the reason they boundaries are uh
but it button
i think
because it depends when you when you use a remote
you press the buttons with your combination
yeah moving to um
i showed it one and maybe
or maybe you want something that shaped like a mobile fire
so you you hold it in once you press about the buttons actually very sign tended to
yeah just just um sometimes huh
but i mean in order to get to all of them you know yeah there have to be within a certain amount of you've only got mode
four five buttons anyway so it's still this motion
it when i'm when i'm pressing buttons i'm out like that so i do it hold it in
s. is the order in one hand yeah and you press
you press the buttons yeah and we can use
my thumb and pointer finger on the touch rather
right below the icsi o_g_i
we are like i found
is the the button on an ipod is it what is it is it just four buttons or is it implied
well there's one available here
with him each version of it has been a little bit different
the one i have doesn't have
the for a new like uh you have one of the in between lines when they were doing that anymore
when you press the center button that's that you won't be so much fun
oh okay this one is going to add down there
yeah
anyway the good for us is 'cause like you could have the same we'll sort of factor for
like
channel flipping and then the other like if you like for volume like just the idea of like both
so few buttons for main things but then i go back many oh
and like
i don't know if we would want on the screen there
on the actual t_v i kinda am wanting to stay on the t_v 'cause
for changing the brightness once you wanna see it happening to you
and
and it still has a real screen might be
good in
theory but not as useful we do this in practice
yeah also yeah 'cause you would be looking down and we'll see this is my copy t_v and then people don't wanna do that
okay um
we have about fifteen minutes left so i'm i'm in it
continue with my present presentation um and one more slide before we close but in that site is when we need to make decisions buttons these kinds of things so i'll just bring up
it
sure you'll
well we we
um
any more information on fruits and vegetables
how much
yeah
changeable covers like for your mobile
in different fruit vegetable colors yeah
the
you spoke and latex covers could be spongy latex
where n. but the actual model could be taking you if you could
could be with you
perhaps i probably affected um
for example to
the the packaging
it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel
so instead of opening the box you just kind of peeler remote control
i'm a little bit the bullet like that i can do this
i think was so overcome
phone
the way it all comes out
um
oh versions
okay um components concept
energy
sure oh oh yes
right i'd sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get
be necessary but
um this is that this is the agenda they gave me so he just a little over
decisions like the
okay to sit
this is going to agree on
that's based on the battery you um
to people
this
kinetic battery i guess i think there are certain maybe it's really cool
yeah
yeah i mean
okay
totally take a problem of not wanting to change that it's
yeah
no i think it's good to this as long as we consider the the cost to uh
how reliable it is
programs are really gotten any is good
cost yeah any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular batteries
but
um
but over time but if we're using any
uh cheaper chip they are leaving out i think
um circuit boards
um yeah i do bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced they're they're thin fiberglass with copper wires latched onto them
and i think they're quite easily printed on by machine which chip-on-print is when the machine prints on the wires and solder it all together for us
i don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions i wasn't really given any options i was just given that this is how they're done
okay
um
yeah i can't really tell you i can i can tell you a lot about how it works
but i don't know any decisions on
if they're if they're really optional
i'm sorry i'm looking for circuit boards and productions and
his family
understand
um okay the m_f_c_k_l move on to the case
um oh but i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple a regular and advanced chip okay here's the here's the thing on the chip set uh
that i got um
simple regular advanced chip-on-print the chip-on-print includes an infrared sensor so we don't have to worry about that
um
okay the push-button
if we're gonna have push-buttons they require a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and an l. c. d. requires advanced
do we wanna scroll wheel or do we just want push-buttons
um
i don't think we need really need disk
it will i mean it might be nice for changing the volume
it'll be nice for changing the volume but i don't know how useful would be for changing the channel because you don't have control over numbers are you are you really need buttons is neutral
it be handy for going through it
if there was an on a menu of your channel choices
then you can scroll you could scroll through the channels
and then the volume or just light minutes left for the meeting and the volume and just be like the same way
yeah foreign backgrounds
i'm just thinking like it would make it much like speaker
sort of looking
yeah
and otherwise no matter how many buttons we have are gonna have like you know black with red sitting down there no it's gonna never really sort of start looking like
you know it's gonna sound like we ones having uh stacked up
um
so
have a scroll for volume
or for all those secret functions
when you get on the on screen menu of all your functions that your remote
could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus
i think you know i think the scroll wheel would be nice but it's not necessary
right
so we can either go with a simple a regular chip depending now maybe we could table others them later
um no
i think well i think when we go into the user phase we're gonna have to decide the interface we have to decide um
whether i have a school or not well let's think about that well we talk about case against a case i i'm kinda like in the idea of latex
if if spongy is the in thing
i'm a little um i'm more hesitant about it because i'm worried about protecting stuff on the inside
okay
um could be horrible and then attacker everything that i would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone whatever kind of thing what i've seen
just not related to this but of latex cases before is that
there's like a hard plastic
inside it just cover it with a latex okay not to speculate on windows just enough to be cripple
like my candles or or anything that you've seen like that
the inside is hard
i don't think we need to worry about
project in a circuit board i think that that's fun for us okay
so we it we do want latex
yeah
okay
text uh who
probably in colors maybe for the vegetable colors
yeah
pretty galleries
okay um let's go to the of user interface then then after that
devices
oh and we wanna curved case yeah
or double curved
well we don't really with the differences right in thinking curtis i'm sorry yeah
yeah okay
we don't really know what the difference
um
okay interface the type and the supplements
so
pushable or scroll
right
you have
um
and i think if we wanna keep our costs um we should just go for push-buttons
because then we can have uh a simple chip
uh and
it's simply it's it's cheaper to make push-buttons and there is a scroll doesn't get us in terms of the
in terms of
economics it's probably better to
and if we had a screen on screen um
kind of thing that you could scroll through like you can use the buttons to scroll through the years
you know it's
i think it is fairly simple
for channel surfing i think the scroll an actual like an ipod kind of scroll thing would be too fast
yeah
i see
push-buttons at least unless we get any information i have no idea how much more expensive the scroll wheel is then
and push-button but it's gotta be some more expensive so
no i think it might be better to
put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery in the cookies too
yeah
is it is it is you do you feel yeah and let's like see fig anything else i mean i'm not
records all of the scroll wheel it's more just to give it a different kind of look but is it gonna be a latex
pick thing that's gonna look cool um
that's quite a bigger impact on school room
yeah
okay so we're gonna go with um
type
push-buttons
yeah
and then supplements how are we gonna do that
oh what you mean by supplements
um
i assume that's what else we're gonna like the um like the additional buttons we can use
um so we have like a menu button
you'd so that we can access on screen things
yeah
then okay um so we're doing it on screen menu so they don't square buttons gonna be powered off
on-off uh volume
favorite channels
oh so like when you're wherever you go
you may your tape stars that are you know you're a little remote you results
um
we said channels
and then we're gonna need um numbers
one two zero
oh we wouldn't even the numbers
i think maybe numbers seems this kind of all the energy he said it
check i guess you can just hold it down
yeah when you know you can just do the scrolling i need some kind of
i dunno so up-down kind of button yeah the volume control type of remote
for example
yeah
okay um intention meeting now um i'd actually exactly thirty minutes um you need to have things to do look-and-feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modeling clay
yep
so is the training
you basically um do we said on a chip let's go with a simple just able to yeah
yeah and and it'll take you everywhere
uh i think these are the in our shared folder okay cool
heh
great
i wasn't expecting it
good
oh
okay
right
okay
oh
oh
um
okay
okay
okay um
welcome to our detailed design meeting
in particular
he started
okay
approximately fifteen forty or something
okay
okay
uh he attended we're gonna do lip opening and then
um i'll
ten minutes from last meeting what we did just fast
um
the we'll have the prototype presentation an in depth look at the evaluation criteria
well the finances
and finally do production evaluation and close
so starting off with um last
the last one i down here
um but we talked about energy we're gonna use a kinetic battery
um we want to use a simple chip because we're not gonna need a shuffle them
you can use a scroll
um which is in a latex case
with fruity colors it's curved
and
um we're using push-buttons
and with this segment of the on screen menu
so it sounded like we had said to um
like eight or nine buttons
including five percent chips
okay
let's do the look-and-feel design presentation first
but
what is the
right well we have a three different prototypes and i guess we'll start with with this one um
we have our colors not
are not fixed that this is the general shape
um it's you
sort of
yeah like
this you can't already stretch it over and then
so easily adaptable to either hand
you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push them with your
index finger for other hand or even i mean there's a whole variety can all the like this impressive with your same index finger
uh we have the on-off button at the chip is very visible very big
we have ah
up and down buttons which are also gonna be a channel selectors and we have a little menu button here
if you push
if we just pushing is not really the the menu buttons if the the volume buttons rather if you press select once they become channel changing buttons
if we press select three times in the menu with the other features
and part possibly also with here
t_v channel choices shows up and you have your five preset stuff here
and people want
file folders that see how it feels in your hand
that's our number one prototype
um
you wanna
present the potato or shall we go margin using the little labels and it will take a bit
you can buy one one plus uh
the
you must run this on this one is known as the potato
uh it's
uh huh
how can i presented
it's an ergonomic shape
so it fits in your hand nicely um
it's designs to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand
um i've gone i just uh just before buttons on this one
um
two glue buttons here after adjusting the volume second volume up
uh volume down on the other side yeah
um the ones are for it
oh changing
channels
channel up and channel down and that's um moves between
your favorite channels that you've selected
uh this middle button yeah brings up the on screen menu
and money working on screen menu
use the other four buttons to navigate to a menu system
and the middle button uh to select
uh it's
that's basically it must tighter
um on off
uh but would be one of your channels basically satellite channels there would be
just issues which initially enough yeah
could the middle button on the on screen menu function of the power button
um
but
um don't really need it would make it hard to turn the machine off
to turn your t_v off
if you press and hold it maybe
you know you don't want to do you agree on on off
so possibility into
and then finally we have
um the martian or the parent
either way um it's a bit different
just
a little bit more of a creative field
i have the on off
toggle stamina
on the top
oh
we have the five preset
seeps
but
and then you have all the sides to make it a little bit more three dimensional you have your channel changing volume changing buttons on the menu button right here in the middle
so
that's for your consideration as well as plus is interesting talking wait to have standing up we figured it could stand up like this on your table if you wanted to if i read about the bottom flap
so i put down the bottle right uh the menu select button
it's very interesting this this is a favorite restaurant software prototypes um
basically in terms of making decisions what we need to do is
first of all decide on the for uh which are three different shapes the remotes then
decide what kind of button do we want how many buttons and then to choose what comes we want to make the buttons and if we want to put any text on the device like labels on the buttons or
broadband labeling
oh
an argument or whatever
we were we were thinking that
normally we go for fruity colors but maybe
we're also thinking about you sort of
middle aged
man
for an example customer might not want a fruity colored remote sown
maybe
we'd have one version that's a bit tone down
okay maybe with with less contrast on it
there's something still a little bright to make it hard to lose but
but we don't want it to look like could story
yeah that was one thing that we brought up over email i don't know if you picked up your email on the uh on feature that we considered for not getting lost right well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that you know
and
we think that each of these are so distinctive
that it's not just like another piece of technology around her house it's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen you so we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be
a script on channel composite technicality since then
small
would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like i don't you
take to your
to your t_v and on that when you press it yeah a little like b. goes off
that would be
conceptually possible
i think it would be difficult technologically because if you only few remotes lost
it's probably on diversity
and in that case you can't be shown send an interesting signal to that
you will lose so it's
i'm not quite sure that's why we can i wonder if it's
if it's more just a gimmick than anything else
i wanna know
how many times do you really
seriously lose your remote control would
with a device like that actually help you to find
there might be something that you can do in the circuit board in the chip
to make it make a noise or something but it would take a lot more development that we have this afternoon
okay
that's on their evaluation
given
um we so we don't we decided not to worry about that for now
yeah 'cause more designs are very bright so you're right they're gonna stick out
uh you said do people have a preference as far as feeling functionality
yeah like mrs
simple words are sort of already possess so for trying to think of something
sort of like anyone find you know this is like
well your initial i'm initially drawn to do just that it's like comparable and i cannot different
i sort of like this one like i don't know why i just it's like small but still all
sort of like you're looking at now
but i also like the the side buttons on our own like i think that's kind of me
but
and how much any of this has to do with it
the fashion and bob
sort of cool looking
thing that we also need to focus on
could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on on both
so then we'll we'll uh we'll yeah that's good
the
yeah
sticker
that's the job
um and why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria most money like i think we're supposed to have one that we do it for oh okay
okay i was so small they examples to develop i mean i have to like writes on the whiteboard south
yes or just right on right now i actually don't have like uh
halfway down to make cuts
it could be done
yeah
it's kind of like a joystick anything
yeah cool and they
maybe a little smaller than than i do like it but customers
this is for two years
no it doesn't kind of like you look at the phone
fruits
true
okay thank you for for uh
i could have an standpoint i could do kind of like the standard like
yeah
i don't solve the gatekeeper gripped so
'cause it goes in between anger and um
just things like this one
okay it's everybody learning then this detail
i like the idea of the arguments to i mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down
that one who
i am worried about like um using the menu
um
in uh it
like in within menus their submenus and so how do you get back to the main menu
well that's on the ipod for example you just every time you wanna go back hit the menu button again it brings you back one level
but that has a menu button separate from the select button whereas if this one's above the menu and select a button
this is a disk in the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for this to true
that's right
define the choice that you want so you press that uh you press the right button
uh
could these are used for going to answer the just we're going into multiple software is maybe it could be one of those if you press down hold
for two seconds means you back one level are you
okay well as long as we have that in mind as we're designing itself
yeah
okay so which one we sort of roughly let me have to draft
whether or not it
these are just
um necessities
but they'll only one thought
the material are willing to present at the time so
okay well we cannot doesn't change it after we go through this month so basically we video
isn't that things that we talked about
before we need to make sure that remote actually guys
conform to the things that is that is going to help so always want to do is we each need to separately
right each of the final thing that all tabulated average just to make sure
she doesn't need that also
pastime
let's go around
the ontology are still one sided with
one me really pseudo
and then we can
not true at all or fall off
if the remote every created
can more sit by criteria so we can do this one first
first one i know he needs uh in the look-and-feel
um object yeah
so i can i can hang up
for japanese
yeah well i was probably somewhere else i'm with a life
right
that's just fine
yeah
i was
you should go
i i kind of think it's it to you could have that i'd give it a one or so
no matter what give a dollar to there
i would give it
one
um crafted it's creative i don't know if fancy is the word boundaries
i don't know if any of them are and
in
i'd say
to because i'm unique
i have to
so
what's on
alright i seems our scale for functionality is functional
i think it's true much longer to one
one
i think it is
it's functional is also pretty basic so there too
right
um
functional
i think it'll get everything done i think it might be a little confusing
first
um
well there's no that's that's gonna be a later went okay then i may give it a two
oh
um i don't say this technologically data
did you functional
as you said
um is it technologically innovative yet
who
not really i mean
that so much as we don't have any screen you don't have
in the chat
other than what it looks like i don't know if it is
well the kinetic battery the battery
eight synthetic one cell
oh you will notice
but it but don't you definitely hear it will be like a i have never change the batteries may have like latex them against the wall opposite material
is it includes a lot of features that are made it really
yeah
uh i won't say that
it's
yeah
like fancy versus creative it's it's
different
the design innovative i dunno
i'll give it a three
oh
oh
so it's technologically is not
it's not unique i mean this is just
is it is it just push buttons um
so a pitiful
i think it will go the four as well
oh right
really
battery there
next is it easy to use just say no easier one will be separate you can't
okay
overlap them
i think it's places
all of it
the chip
oh
okay no one
pretty hard to mess up
what's that one
now it's a two
right
um being as long as the if it had the spongy holiday
and if you did the latex rubber right is spongy okay
for one uh
i wonder if it bounces when you drop it yeah
who then they'd be hard to break character do you like to be less impact we knew where you go out to work
alright and and exited integrate some gaussian of fruits and that is
oh about uh uh well it it yeah uh oh
it might be 'cause that's our corporate color isn't it
that's right yeah corporate color we didn't keep that in
you are going to be yellow
well if we
i don't make it a little less could a little more confusing but if we had all the buttons and black and designing and the outside and yellow that'd be a corporate one and then we could also have all true colors one or more conservative one
one is more fertility kind of way or something
yeah
we have this um and can we have like an r. r. inscribed on the bottom or something sure
kind of
right so it it really sorry about that skill
so it's i think it's it's kind of a newly to oh i i look around and see over here that's the most rich yeah oh i know that there and number
one
i had to
one battery um and the design it match that appropriately remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use the channel copying the volume boast
i think we really have that hot sony one
yeah in retail
so what
using one of those
yes
okay on also we talked really about ah i fly in winds for that
um
sorry
a whole family
thing
we think that the latex sort of greater
appropriately take that into account
i think all the material 'cause i guess you know where you are
it's gonna be hard to do
and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that are constantly pushing that on
i mean i'm one of the best and like outfits in the handle
so
and i caught the tail
uh i'll say two as well because older people that are used to like texting by the time my friend okay
you
well at first
yeah so i said to
right
yeah
the user wearing yeah
i know you say you are a little bit error stuff uh
and now it sort of reminds me of the a guy and i just got i saw read the instruction book and it okay go
and i'm not good at learning to
not really
so i'm going to go
the menu system and uh the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing but i think that's one of one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out but you'll have it afterwards
so i i think i'd give it to i guess
i think it
it's probably a little out of the mess with most of them because you have to
you have to use the menu system and you have to
tell you what your favorite channels are well could take a better remote object first yeah but
once you if you want to learn how to use it
because the buttons and so on group of
what is it
i think it give it a four two it's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy once you've done it but
them
alright um
also earlier read something about losing hands an hour nap addressing that at all
so
we we i think we can kind of see we tested with color
okay so in terms of having it do you think that i yell
but the seven
how easier is that
totally
um and i'm gonna give a one or something there
we can still image memory can be a year kind of background by about many more often it's gonna stay
um i z. given uh three
is it depends how
tidy work on you
give it for
okay before 'cause
it would be easy to lose small to
i gaussians so simplicity
oh how old is it
i guess just me
paul
sports a user simple in design
yeah overall 'cause we've said there were two meetings or simplicity batch and so there was an exhibition
yeah
separate from the icsi
like
after that
um
yeah like once we example but it's not like totally x_m_l examples so um and give it
i'll give it a three i guess
we'll give it to
three
oh yeah fashion well
it's totally fashionable
i don't think that i'm going to look very hard out of any bigger i think it's very technology and fashions
oh really i i don't know i don't think it's quite especially was by robot or both
they do it like that
it requires a relatively like others uh search
the fruit
number uh
so
three
one
and doesn't need are like
demographic and he saw uh for international he'll
that whole thing
so it's server items
oh why not
hm
i think as long if we offer in and
in at least three different color arrangements
oh yeah yeah that's good
so given until
in
she
right i don't have any other features that they think are important that we didn't talk about
well um we didn't
we didn't address the fact that it does need to have a corporate level solids
let's make sure we keep that in mind that we have that one of our colors concept is for bread and has an r. on it while i think all of those notion are yeah
and so we're
okay so what is it
oh okay
oh well
oh really
okay now we're gonna look at finances um i have an excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost
um
oh
but and others
hm hm
okay um uh yeah i know
really
we were space
it is you in your work
um
okay
hand dynamo
we using phonetic batteries right in that yeah
um i'm having one per
one okay
um electronics
single
simple example and uh
okay
um the case
well uh
just double curved
it is different yeah it's very query so okay
yeah they get a picture of it so i don't know
a case material supplements
sweet
johnny plastic and
no we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is a seen bad side of it is
the what i guess it was rubber rubber is rubber and special color
yeah
you get more than one special color
yeah we're using all this through special pre release two special colors
um i don't know because it the basic color is another yeah
well we know that we're having these three higher so you're saying what are we talking about on each
color combination are we
no we'll like we'll have yellow and black
is that
two special colors
i don't know or that andreas wainwright the agent mulder or
uh
i guess is three seen three three three ever
the following
maybe are are we in color as well so you know interface we do push buttons yeah but how many buttons do we have
sex
five
i'm not tasks with the power
so
anything else
no oh we'll do we'll
all buttons and special colors machines
to get the pitch away oh buttons oh so um
so the case material we just have one color
right
but nobody is will be in special colors or making multiple varieties of
this is what i'm getting confused
we're saying per unit
yeah i'm here okay so each unit will only have one color right in each new button but the cases
could have up to three i mean the buttons could each could be up to three colors as that's how it's designed there i like i like that um
okay
special form
they're all kind of just push button no i think than define special material you want the rubber as well probably yeah so
oh what do you do per button do i
no i don't think so
i think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters
yeah absolutely fabulous 'cause holman case material to one yeah it's minutes to make a rubber okay oh wait maybe
thirteen point seven
oh
yeah
what can we were gonna just have our buttons all be one color
um you can click the button and is
it's already started to two point three anyway
okay uh i we service double curved maybe it's single but i have no idea we've got
i don't know i didn't get any measures
yeah it's better to see through
yeah but that was not yet
okay it's a kinetic battery that's kind of expands and
but we have a simple chip single curve
case material is rubber and it's a special color
yeah
but that's important
this is six buttons
how do we know sixty thousand is just teens
well it's almost thirteen and now it's fifteen
no okay maybe not
i don't know what just happened
for me
that's twelve
i was not target price again
top drawer ipac oh someone just
so we're okay
right thinking
yeah i know
ish
okay backgrounds that
um stay
i think that to our um
ah
big shared folder so you know
um okay
in fact um agenda
oh
um i the other costs under twelve fifty euro yeah yeah yeah they are for the last the project evaluation
project process
satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership
teamwork there needs
any new ideas found
so i guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating
how we create this project information we guide uh menus how we used to it
if we're able to um
you know news or creativity with the information
um how old how well i guess i and that it's
um
the uh how well we work together as a team
um
the digital pens the whiteboard
yeah
okay
i feel very creative
i could do it
making the prototypes
i think we've been successful in but really
to achieve
almost all of the design goals we set ourselves to start
and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got separated cost
i think we could have done even better with a little bit more information limits the single curved case how many colors
what the colors count
um things but given given what we had i think we did we did really well
um
i think we worked together pretty well
yeah
yeah i never play that more
market research in industrial thing that could have taken that until now but the fruits of vegetables divided by creativity and i'm willing to them the whole thing going to your screen
um i mean
i do think though the pen little distracting for me personally
like a tapping us um
or just being so conscious of
turning the heater them down
yeah but of a distraction
yeah
that's fine
i chose not to do a powerpoint saying that it made sense to us i like that i had the option to do that and just stick my own notes within that sort of thing
yeah i think we all made um very significant contributions i don't think anybody dominated it
which i thought was really good like each of us
i was able to um like if you had information i
um i try to facilitate it with that
like taking over um
yeah you can a little fish models
if there really keep the current one one does it get we work at this this bangor uh
sure you have that somewhere on the packaging
i have little trying to think of a good plan that they could add there but
i think it's a good like one single
ooh yeah there are are gonna be patched in yes
hopefully that would just figured out
some point but
um
could be useful to look at it
of things that you design that has a huh
okay um what to bring new ideas thousand
people should really base their votes literature vegetables that and i will
or or at least be could put creative enough to speak of
toggle switches see
i said and
i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now however joe evaluate them
yeah i was even know they exist to anybody get watches that happen like really quite expensive watches
that is never need a battery 'cause you're always looking directly to
but in other things i think it'd be really good
and it yeah
a task
um
okay closing
but the cost in the budget
is the project evaluated
those final questionnaire and meeting summary
um
so this great products kids i think we've
created from the really interesting and then we have a market for it
um
especially if we can produce at twelve point three which we help
um
yeah
make sure in your question or put down
criticisms of
well the process on um
the final results and
yeah real yeah if you like the mercenary mode we could use more than one that would be my second job that w. a. second-rate out of the top toggle i'm afraid in there and bring it reveals apparently didn't bring it it it certainly has like what has happened is
as this document then
alright
so that's funny
yeah
i guess it started as up
care that it started like you were like a bunch of whether anything when i didn't have that in in between them
yeah
as it stands uh
um
well
we actually bracketed some remote control comparing them
so ah oh oh oh oh well uh
but um
it
really
congratulations
um
if you see
nothing will come up with laughter with its posterior is redundant
yeah
um i believe
yeah
it doesn't matter classes anybody this thing like taking matters class that's only going but that's the company words yeah but check it out so like all these like blanks that are gone
you know that all you need to keep in mind german knowledge management
there is one major you don't
well first reduce that make it really to do the job because it's products then uh it's okay
it's it's very work relevant considered as they were out
yeah definitely
they said that they give you links to the corporate website
oh oh here you could see we did little to recover website
this is just inspiration about circuit boards
it's really one
it's the world
get it so cool
that like something is pretty cool yeah so that excel it's one like the references inspiration
basically many two sentences non flashing blue
by comparing thing
um has nothing to yeah my inspiration from from last time this is in the interior of a remote control being taken up a bit by bit talking about circuit boards
i learned a lot actually um i could probably take apart a remote control now if i really needed to
the summer school are we have all table and everything
no hello
circuits and chips and
trends ponders look i wrote it down because i thought it would be relevant by all the different parts of the inside of a remote control but then
three like you don't actually have this
do you think of it like would you prefer outside his group or multifunction remote control that i didn't have like any kind of table
one seven somebody else the questions are for their school
it's really interesting
i thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this
thank you
yeah yeah you need a lot of um
otherwise the technology today is kind of cool
who knows really how to get
you can
we didn't use the whiteboard that much
no
although i don't see how
we call it have
very a lot at least for me
i
it is yeah if i'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case
the different looks of the case i would probably john
you
some applicability anything i think usually like reports are good
no question ideals or like
if we had like a bring they were gonna gonna brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it but then you're going to with only four people it doesn't really
makes sense given without any with the powerpoint that we can all look at like you can do all those things pretty much on powerpoint
yeah
does anyone easily so that
made us more minds like take notes and uh
like made up here 'cause all needed them separately kind of in the whiteboard in this room
because we're all gonna be working
in different places
yeah
it
if we're all gonna stay here all the time and having the notes up on the whiteboard
but it alright but everyone needs to know like specific notes i guess
now when you were um creating your
um projects or did you work together or did you have like two separate projects
oh bring reports global
yeah i remember we were making
what
with so many different shapes and um
discussed uh uh
how the buttons work work
we will
and
how we could load improvement
with those words
there's a bit of both really are we just kind of started out by taking a color of claim
just fooling around that i came out with that run the shape in him and that sort of potato re
when do we shape
and then swung from there really
cool
it was fun
it
displays anything management i thought well managed
oh
oh really
the first group of people go with seems different
this recognition actually
will we did a good job of marriage
for decisions against it
back scoring they don't have any other type of
and what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have ratings and then
people so just the way we about anything actually really being decided
we figure we don't
we do clearing and decisive
decisive breaks down a bit of the meetings so that we
we knew what to do one
yeah i was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we were getting
we didn't really have enough them information to make firm decisions about we're able to do it regardless so
i'm not usually a very decisive person said to have people finish
this this isn't able to
compare them
i found that we did it we could have used another five or ten minutes
yeah especially last term you yeah
yeah i think the last time we had a lot of information
in at the same time
not quite enough
you know what i mean
we we couldn't answer every single question
um
but
and i i felt the first two meetings that i was coming in when no information and that sort of
you mean you really
i don't know the ring together powerpoint of no no interest again last time it was like the opposite
and so much information and so much to talk about
is interesting what came out like later like as i was doing then
when i was doing a breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um that more points came out from your presentation even
um
i'm a little animals when that we didn't do a um
something for losing the remote
yeah that was kind of a big point of that or something like
in order to talk about that we would have had to have actual knowledge about
circuit board so that yeah handling is gonna be just for creating on the
excel file that wasn't like
the option to select it to
so no not influence there is no way we could do like yeah i really didn't do there's no way restaurant
continue down that i was really there i think we were just getting over enthusiastic with the task
we wanted a single guy into it i mean i got into it
as they went on i got really like who were displayed a remote control
professors menu button knows about
it was interesting that they put that fifty percent of people say they have research with losing the remote and if they didn't provide us with information to
yeah but um
yeah remember
we should
discuss that
i know that like people
people have like
things they can put on the keys the precedent will be yeah but i but i'm sure that would require some kind of technology that
yes or no but it at least there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things
so you won't lose them you
i don't know i mean we were talking about it in like
in in my household at least there's only about two places that the remote is ever you because there's only one t_v and
there's only like into a chair just he isn't always two in the morning
you lose them in your pocket like usual forget that
or like put it down from her to like me exams and then
now remember there's always with so there's things
yeah
it it depends on how organized you are personally you are like current guess what the side of the house is to you
but i mean
i am not sure areas for losing my key strategy i guess up several of them
the company
he's in the refrigerator the other for example
so it's pretty clear issues away
and um
good
uh i mean you you take yourself to the bag of putting whether this rated
back to my room
kick it in kick it is what color i like it should
definitely in the vegetable sure little bits
but we see that the a break overnight using a different code
um
yep
but i think it's good we don't really care to answer that much yeah
can only take into them and
leaving you with very little robot but we could happen however
robot alien pair or whatever his have a little voicing
i am located
yeah
or
i t. p. s.
put it into the deep yeah
um
no
so if it's sitting still for machine made when the block by itself can be able to get a model that you were really isn't crazy like a lecture magnet that you push it all with you individually it's and it didn't look but is it just amelia
just that you're it
but you have to ever but for your remote
let it give it didn't you
if you want but if you can attach them to the t_v and yeah
yeah
one
um
um and sometimes those
just
so i'm just um
to now take minutes
insight into what you have sent to the email saying that powerpoint minutes will be complementary rather than like
repeating i'm just gonna make
making full minutes so that it will include all of the agenda and um i think
it seems like how
she felt the most typing organizing to do
i didn't have like information to
slash
yeah anytime soon
how much of your powerpoint was already done for you
every meeting noticed it
um i added slides um
added a couple slides each time that's fine
and they do anything slides 'cause
i would just get slides were titles on the new building a number
i didn't even think about having one
well the thing was it would provide an agenda was like several points but it wouldn't be assigned for each point
uh and that's the only way i remember that i did not have a point
that i know personally when i do powerpoint decided you know
so i headed ones even if it was just like the title of it like this representations and immediately
it into the slogan on it i can just be like
the slogan on in our depending on
with like in durham yeah this is uh no i don't think we need to energy stored in our especially the yellow line
black one
it's a killer blow
or yellow and blue when we go to the web pages
yeah i was just kind of going by the web page because they didn't give me any
leah
like yellow rate is lower
current
to bring better than black doesn't have an ability to
i can tell
it's interesting they don't like news clipping it's
finish meeting you know
wasn't it it just seemed that um i thought was interesting that are marked marketing
um expert did not agree with the marketing um
he enjoys it is yeah exactly
well perspective you really want to actually uh
oh really big market evaluation even just have
in one set of
source kind of and they work so now i've backed up would just be a sentence like we did this survey it gives us more people than
yes
i don't know
we always do that
visit it
sort of a great isn't it
yellow and grey that than the slogan than blue
well we've got some great and we have some little buttons we're going
yeah
well the other topics like playing
maybe it like
timit
you know it's
well we're not
sadly going to actually produce a mess though if they work amount
with the three her but it but it about a corpus into words i'm gonna play the intellectual property it uh
yeah
particularly the whole thing is done um until it's been that long
get sucked in
yeah
um i don't know
cindy
oh
yes
it's it's
four seconds
hi guys uh good morning over here
um yeah i want to introduce myself uh many me is uh she the prosody and uh i'm the project manager for this new project which we ought to do is to snow
so i want to introduce first of all uh the names
the colleagues here
and what you're doing
i share my name and segments and i am uh
user usability user interface designer
i z. and i do accounting
uh how you spell your name or e. d.
p. t. k.
do you also do marketing
so only contain
i can't write
i
and i'm christine and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer
the synthesized
and that everyone
so who's uh marketing of marketing is uh is me
you know
so uh us thanks for coming from the meeting first of all
and uh
we have uh
long time just put five minutes to discuss about uh this project and uh the project initiation
first of all i want to ask the must be able to or a marketing plan a newer product line
and uh
well i think you'll see that throughout the day and how we're going to put this together as a marketing to
to mark
product
we'll have to see
five three discussion about where we're gonna go for
this
um
but to be already have like a functional design or a technical design uh for the moment idea
for the moment not yet okay but uh what's what's your or did you have some project plan
something
sure
good question
no as i said we have to be discussed between all of a single phone
exactly
yeah it's a program to work out the other
okay so
oh by when you think and you can uh
give me some kind of uh project plan
okay discussion it certainly by the next meeting
my next meeting okay that'd be great
uh
okay so does any questions or uh as before
what uh
this project
where is the goal project
uh the goal of the project i think maybe i will uh handle to the it
it's my
the project
but he's in the sale sign or colon in the sailors explain what to do
where they define exactly what our product is from uh
yeah it's uh can you explain uh what exactly the book series
for one i had on mine
we're supposed to marketing coffee
it's a great
uh i think uh i'm not phone we're making the remote control remote controls 'cause i had two different things i have the first part of mine was to make a remote control for new remote control for television
right after i had a discussion about coffee so
we'll start with the remote control for television now
three of the design something that is very user friendly
something uh
visually has something that we will draw people to buy the product
because i think everybody's experienced with the remote controls some remote controls are hard for for throwing out the window
uh the
most or all but i don't know we have to come up with a new idea
how to make it
a lot easier to use
um
it's a lot of times
spend
half a day through the
instruction book trying to figure out how to use it
yeah yeah
and uh
what about kristin what about your uh the industrial design plan
or do
i would design already on this
product or the
you still working on the design
um
no i i have not began working on the design
and um
i uh
i actually didn't know we were designing a remote control i thought we were designing a new monitor um
the
web site i went to look at
i had some announcements about an introduction of a um
uh some sort of a seven inch hound monitor
and um
i
understood that that was the project goal
so um i'm glad i didn't do any work um ahead of time because
i really didn't understand the project goal
okay
um
i just
i did see that we're starting a new project together and that was before member team compress of these people
and um
that's bad ten
that's and i i read through the different steps and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps
so you will be leading the team for your design team or how many members is looking in the team
the design of for the industrial design yes
um why would they think that depends on how much money you give us
if somebody because uh you know he can they can make it uh
yeah different choices of different financial models yeah but there before we talk about the the finance okay
uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market
and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's still individual also
well you know um i kind of think that in general you have to do uh
um you have dozens very fashionable
that's a very attractive that um
people see and recognize set its goal and uh they immediately wanna have it uh
have one of their own so it would it would need to um
something like the ipod would be good seems to have caught on fairly well so
um
you know okay what it does just so it looks cool
okay
but uh of when you think you can give me like uh
kind of for design of the functional design of the technical design
well i got a lot of the projects i'm doing right now
um and so i'll have to wait and see how those uh have those go if they are go quickly and then it could be a month with um
if i run into any problems in my other projects he might be six months
yes but uh i need something in the writing so like uh what's your functional design what's the technical design
and uh how many people you need for this project and what's the time frame you're looking looking at the what the budget maybe uh initial particular working
okay i and uh always going to the market okay so do you have to me to be the marketing team another way to market and what are the marketing strategy plan
okay when are you going to introduce okay and by the time introduced a product a day in order that would be a competition okay so i need some kind of uh
well
the
clad in the writing from you
okay
and logical thing
as soon as possible
i have one
if uh
if we have enough time uh
then then d. seem to um
two weeks is uh is close enough
yes i think that would be good because i need to go to the management tend to tell them what we are going to do and uh what's cost-wise okay and what's the time frame when what's the project plan
because uh without any other documentation so i cannot put it on management and says okay we'll want to do this and we need this much money okay so then
it's it's difficult for me to say perfect season i need uh some kind of plan from you initially okay then we can how the for the discussion again
uh
are there other people who will be contributing to the plan
yes of course if you did some helper also let me know so the people you need the from the marketing or uh the technical side or the administration point of your page three adding in a documentation or some technical point obviously just like my nose like an important call that intel can get plenty on this thank you
and uh added uh oh so what's what you think about uh
this project
for the remote control and did you have some already won something for your marketing strategy or uh the same strategy
right now yeah other than uh doing research and taking remote controls are looking what other companies have to do uh what are building
their designs their ideas uh
also to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into
yeah
there should be a fairly large market because uh
the number of people that uh
competition
yeah
uh i agree has to be something has to be something
has to be something that that draws people say hey i like
yes
whether worse or not any of the first say i like this i like the design
and this can be simpler to use
yes
so what i uh for for maybe uh unique imply uh more with the christy okay because
you know what she's going to do
okay and you know how to serve it
i see
because
uh she's doing the design but you're the core because you're the marketing okay as a bit you need to sell any you're responsible for the all the money to finance okay two more
so what i for for okay so you need to interact with the christian more and have it in our team okay with splitting the functional design our technical design okay and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan okay how you're going to do those
your sales but
okay the real audio cost
no but on this the an idea of how much uh we want to mark this for edges of the cell for a headset
that's up to us to decide here so that you ought to decide okay so the best thing is you well both of uh the christian and you will discuss it yourself locate and come up with the cost and how we are going to
compete in the market okay and uh
technically or in the sales wise look at the commercial wise
okay then we ought to design okay how long it will take the whole project okay
how much is going to cost us and how much we are going to but but for the company
okay
of course it's it's uh uh
but for for everybody in direction
okay
so i think it's uh maybe if he can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan okay
including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the t. okay then it will help me to discuss with the management for for the looking and put it in the the proper project plan
and if you need it
any coordination in between uh come back to the maybe there are some technical wearing the solar commercial vendors okay depends if you want to have some off a marketing plan or technical plan okay so let me uh
okay i coordinate
or maybe
uh
your mike or can accommodate
um between uh
well no not exactly i mean my job from what i understand was
so like at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use outlook of the best ways to do that
yeah
so i think i'll have to interact with christina suggested her yeah
so that she's not designing something back
my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to our and so it's sort of it's only that feeds and but
i don't think necessarily that
i mean is
in a coordinating
position yeah so basically you need to interact with kristin more okay for the user acceptability
yeah yeah and the testing courtney then which will also feed into the marketing yes depending on what users want depends on how you sileye it might tag lines you attach to a
how you do it
make it more attractive to users i think
all three groups so we'll need to interact quite a bit
uh
i guess build the plan based on all of that is something you need to take other factors into account
what a request okay the keep it in the low yeah easy you are uh meeting in christian meeting because he should know what's happening yeah we can see see hands on many discussions of most and reasonable based on the males look at all the discussions to me because i need to submit to the manager
uh-huh
so any questions for our time being
so the immediate next that fails to start determining the functional design you this
so come on the functional design and uh to discuss with and locate how it wouldn't work and uh first of all with the work
user acceptance yeah okay how it looks like and how it's going to work in the market
okay
so then we can discuss about uh for other things okay so
and uh
with this time
for the meeting
okay
thanks for coming which mind um
at the conclusion of a meeting could do could you send us a copy of your slides
yes ma'am i rent movies yes
i copy uh let let us keep all the emails and all the copies so cliched uh each other okay so you know everybody what's happening
sure
okay
and if anything you need any time so please i do you can call me or just send me email or uh
just come and unlock my door okay so on my machine
good okay
okay thank you
and swimming in the ocean ashton
yes
select
oh
chances are
as instantaneous
for uh this one
state are going to say here
um i didn't know though so yeah
i don't disappear and his
his
thing of interest this there you go i don't need to this for sure
okay uh
it is
we can then information i find
okay we'll come back
i hope for you have uh fresh air in the first time
housed now the meeting actually we
gathering here
to discuss about the functional design
mate
okay and uh we'll see some information from uh on-off you indexing uh i think uh
the shading falter and uh i will invite uh the sixteen ending eight and uh agnes to discuss it work on the various subjects
so you can go to the next slide
uh the agent of the meeting ease of opening
then uh
i'm going to talk about uh the project management what i'm going to do and uh of course i'm doing the project management and secure keyboard
if we can take the minutes of the meeting
and that all three presentations one is uh new project well names
and a segment of wanted a decision on the remote control functions
and uh finally we are closing uh and the meeting time will be all forty minutes
so how to be very quick
and i'll come up with the management going with the new proposal okay and go to discuss with you one of those
oh what's this
your insides
in the aim of your project
but the one that is uh
the teletext becomes the all models
okay because of uh because of the computer systems and uh new technology
so
we don't need to constantly about the teletext and all in all the new project design
the second one is about uh
the remote control
should be used only for the t_v
that's what our management says
i'm not taught while it's a vibrating for dame
to test operation or uh marketing or the corporate image
okay with this new project on your project
so i will invite uh
agnes can you go to the colors yeah
and this is the third side
okay good
so
i let my to existing to discuss about uh the functional design
okay now
and
yeah
so
uh
mm two
yeah yeah
john mister john miller
i dunno
files
so what i am
why i figured uh
we should
um identify some user requirements and from my experience i wanna uh and from
the research i did
uh the
the device has turned television on and off the first time you press on the big button you can't tear
um can have like a war falling on this point two million that he needs to be able to be able to find it
'cause one because problems with
remote controls us
finding them
so uh i also since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product
though they look at things that are popular and um picks go beyond though as soon as i said and first meeting
um yeah and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction especially the yeah the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance and is reliable and so forth
i did a little history on the and the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth so
i guess this guy had seen if i created the flash dramatic
check out like the idea because it made me think of phone um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the t_v on and off that might be interesting
and um it so it was highly directional flashlight
then i could turn the picture on and off and the sound on and off and change channels so i think um those are still requirements we have today uh
fifty years later
and uh what was really a pioneering innovation but it was a sensitive to the sun so that day would get would start off by the you get
with
easily cause um problems
so i
i in addition to uh looking at the um
uh the functional graphs all these devices are examples of where uh l_c_d they represent
examples that are available today
i think that one in the middle
as a person
something to keep in mind be easy to find
hands down
it would uh eat
he did for it things if the t_v didn't turn it off you could
use it for something else
and since i'm not really um
the industrial designer i didn't know what to do with the slide
but um
i just took some
different uh schematics and i put them into this and i guess this is what the site might look like if you were going a circuit board again that i i don't know why i am
the rest is
so
uh
personal preferences
um
i think we could uh up really thinking outside the box here i think that we should consider perhaps
having in it and that the size up
a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference something is very very flexible and inflatable and then you can shrink it
i think
um you could either be you could go either one extreme be very colorful or you could make it clear and um kind of
blend in with things so you don't have to um uh have a problem with the the the decoration of the of the user's home
um i think that it needs to be waterproof because uh sometimes they fall into cups and you know might be a by the swimming pool or something like that
um
if you i remember what what my requirements was about it needs to to tell you when it's done its job or not because at the time i keep pushing on the remote control and i don't know if it's actually
understood my message so i think it should give you some sort of an oral cue
and no course i never want to replace the battery
so that's those are my preferences and that's my presentation
yeah let me uh interrupt you uh if he can add other facility other creature light uh unbreakable
yes will be because uh
especially today you know you have a family and the katz okay and the kids draw tend to play with the remaining time with the color yes okay so if he can add the future okay before you or or fabric whatever you outline design okay with unbreakable locating that will give
a lot of advantage
for our product
good idea as well
good idea how how how do you can uh added in that
yes okay
okay uh-huh tainted justin and uh uh any questions or uh classifications or
any discussion on the functional design
do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials
because for example in the unbreakable thing doing something plastic would be
harder where it is
having something like
i know steel or titanium isn't really economically
yeah
yeah pop up here and they too yeah
no i haven't really um
i want feedback i think we need to re rank these yeah but we'll see what you're a choice no preferences are now i'm just wondering whether
they had any
i like titanium it's light
yeah
expensive
yeah a marketing company
it was great you know nobody told me how much what our financial objective is so one
yeah
if you already inflate something it made you do it uh
this is the last meeting we're supposed to discuss about the financial thing
uh let me go quickly maybe if he can go back
and so project plan and the budget
yes
yes
so
so
yes
yeah it's christians so
this thing
that's mine
uh i think you have it i will send you locate the project may be the the project eight one k.
or the end of the day the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million euros
okay
and uh of course applies will be ready reasonable onto the seat side okay that maybe you give a talk to work the how much the price and the what's there
how much it's cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be saved in the market
then uh you can combine it with your feedback and uh i have one maybe the additional being in this remote control okay
it can be for like even more should be used for any t_v
okay
and with this silly
okay and uh
that
not fat
might be hard to find
but let's try it okay all the different uh the designs okay the functional designs
so any other questions
uh from her side i don't think uh
there's too many questions
okay
thank interested for time being sold and uh
right
okay to the marketing uh for the marketing side just to to give an idea with the managers looking for
but
looking for uh
a remote control to an excuse me
oh
right
have the sale price of twenty five euro
with the production price so tall and half a euro
from what uh i think from or trying to find which one we're looking for i don't think the price is exactly
in the mark
right
okay i'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh
in recent surveys
uh from just from from fifteen to thirty five eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something is fancy this train
twenty five euros uh this
but it's pretty reasonable cause it's more proprietary
yeah for political risk yeah
yeah push this up a bit
make it more expensive but give them added things that they don't have now yeah
then they would it could possibly so obvious that risk is there too expensive than a combine
what
i think uh uh there's one other thing interesting to think of interesting idea
is that uh from the fifteen to thirty five year old room
which i would spend more money on the train the new things
speech recognition is request
we're talking between each seventy five to ninety percent
of this group is willing to pay you for speech recognition or not
obvious we can make a remote into a computer but maybe simple commands
lower
softer
on off
that might be a possibility even though it costs more
be the first on the market to produce that
thirty five percent say the too difficult to use
so it freer we make and more user friendly
uh fifty percent said they can't find the remote half the time
so maybe one word speech recognition commands save remote and there's a beep beep beep and they can find it through you know ten ten the newspapers magazines whatever you have it all
but
the cost that uh the management is looking for a start gonna be possible
but it was trained if it's fancy he's got some color to
it's very easy easy to use it does get simple remote speech remote uh control
what piece of our software change channel
on off
remote because be people like a fireman we'll without spending half a day looking for nearly all of cycling can turn the t_v on
so we have to look at it in
in this global idea
with
the ideas
i did a show
uh design
price obviously we have to talk
so what you think about uh
the design set this to the thing you can make it or or
uh i'm sorry
where did you go about uh the design uh what was talking about speech recognition speech recognition
well uh training is always an issue
okay then
commands so um mike to uh
we can um
perhaps um
do it
if the user is willing to
spend some time in the training process uh could reduce the
uh
the overall um
cost
not sure how
but um anyway
uh um
uh i think also that the this might impact the battery life
and um so maybe what we'll have to do is
um add something where you can
recharge it
wirelessly
so that do you have any sense in power to it
so or maybe a set out and assign it to a you know gets a from the light
um as a solar cell inside their show that uh you have enough
yeah
and used to do all these fancy things
it seems also like with the speech recognition yeah it's a great feature but if you're watching t. v. there's a lot of ambient sound and it's words it's not just you know noises like something hitting
it's actual speech so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough
to filter out the t_v speech
and the the user speech otherwise you can say remote but if someone on the screen is saying the same thing
all of the sudden you have someone in a movie saying often here screen guys
because they trigger the remote control and it's turned out for t_v
so
i think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems
then you have your really good marketing gimmick but
i think we seriously need to consider how that within
it's
the situation very good point
oh yeah
the speech recognition uh
so no
yeah
um good or bad idea but um
if it's so one more
recognition because i know telephones in cars and things i've seen stacey uh friend mouses column all i calls up mode
yeah
okay the radio can be on any everything
because i think's with speech recognition of uh uh remote collect telephone
has it
exactly word
that has to here
i don't think it would come through a sentence
television
somebody speaking with us in the television i stop and say
remote
um yeah
so i think that uh something could be designed to recognize single woman oh yeah
yeah
well i think it's a great idea
if we can design it and say this is your everybody stays with probabilities call
so called it near the end
so it's kind of cute
well what i can uh suggested kristin okay uh if you need some remote
the technical we had
what's implied
okay
okay uh this facility especially for the speech recognition
i can become a new some companies like uh into law i_e um quickly because they're already in this speech recognition part okay
and they can maybe have some uh technical backup from them some kind of for technical tire
okay uh if you want i can coordinate look at to get some information
okay and then uh let me know okay so what kind of uh
the details you require
okay to add this future
in this project
i don't think it's uh the difficult
and uh we need to know how much of the time frame you need to do that
apart from what
really
okay we'll find that out
from from your side there you have to go back to managements
yes the most precise what do they want uh
or risk
take a risk on the market something is gonna cost one but couldn't per user release it may come home in the market
because a seventy something totally different hasn't always told me something that nobody has right
yes dreamcast end of the day you're the sales guy so i will come back and sit on your hard because you're going to be real says prediction okay
it's uh of course it's uh with joe or tell the management how much it's cost as a normal job and she went first okay
and uh so i don't mind to convince okay the management to spend some more money on the project okay if you can make a all pole
well this
money from this well why responses to i don't mind to come as though the management okay the management says okay so that they don't want certain facilities which it's already work okay they want something the new okay i think uh like a speech recognition definitely there lately i don't think the signal for the shapes and uh i hope i can convince the management
okay
so if you have any a new idea also queue for uh you can always combine the you can tell me if you need any
uh as special okay coordination of cubic linear technical company which you can
high-tech technology backup
okay
for fun
hello
simple design okay then i'm very good at
and uh what's your comments about uh
um
well maybe if i go through my presentation you can sort of see what the user perspective is and how it ties into the other two comments yeah
so you'll finish it uh so i can uh
okay i yeah i know to be um
speaking
space
yeah it is
yeah
right
let's see two three oh yeah that's right
okay
so
basically
the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like when people don't like about existing products in our case existing remote controls
and then what the good ideas are what the bad ideas are and why they're bad and good which isn't always obvious we seem to have intuitions about why
things are good things are bad but when you look
technically it how it works sometimes that's not the case
then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep his that'll feed into both
and work kristen's work
um and then what the remote control should look like obviously once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are
so in terms of the functionalities that we need you obviously need to be able to turn the t_v on and off we need to change channels both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing you need to build to control the volume and then control any menus on the t_v
to regulate contrast or whatever
so the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls in general
the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do
um off and you need to know specific button sequences
to get certain functionalities time um which you don't necessarily always remember especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often
and that the buttons are too small
so here we've got two examples where
here on the left hand side you can see a remote control that had lots and lots of buttons the buttons in a lot of cases are tiny
um they're hard dusty and okay they're labeled but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much whereas on the other side you have a much simpler remote control
i think basically has a minimum functionalities
that are needed and it sort of looks simpler and just
less imposing when you first look at it so i would be inclined to go sort of towards this
in terms of designer rather than this
and if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons that we can figure out how to do it with existing
um buttons
so my personal preferences i had to keep the number of buttons to limit our to minimum sorry
make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed so like the on button being really obvious one
the channel changing and the volume
and to keep the design basically sleek and simple
which i think ties into what christine and adam both said
fairly reasonably
um so that's pretty much it and
i don't know if you guys have any
questions or
alright so uh um seems to be very understandable clearly a research and uh
and now as the heading in the same direction
and um
uh
the one thing that i saw a missing for um uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it yes that's true so uh you know but that's okay that's why we're all your tables so that if we think of in our research indicates certain things and and
with its complementary
i also think then it's um
uh
the uh the feel of it
is uh
when you hold it
is something that um
was expressed more in in in in my uh
design oh and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters the industrial designer is more thinking about political look-and-feel
and uh that's definitely a very important factor especially to users who are gonna be in line with thing and then using it almost done
daily basis and a lot of cases anything
okay so how many questions sounds good
so
for anybody need uh any help from for time b.
on this the subjects okay so
this come back to me and uh distant maybe i can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical
other companies to help before i make a design uh slim
okay and to add some features like what we're talking for the speech recognition at all
should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include 'cause we thrown a lot of features onto the table but
do we actually want to incorporate all of them or
we missed anything
you wanna go back and look at the closing slide maybe that would provide some guidance
so
yes and i tell us uh
really this along with decision individual actions
it says user interface so i supposed to do the components concept
supposed to work on the user interface concept and you're supposed to keep watching the trends
uh um in specific instructions will be sent by ah
function
i thought we shouldn't do with many features just to start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process that's my suggestion
okay that would be great
and uh i'll send you uh let me just object if you want
i'm just thinking in terms of time she's objective
yes no not acting nobody will
i'm just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away i mean it takes a lot of
time and effort
for everyone to
consider different features
um
and if we spend the time and effort on features that we're not gonna use maybe it's better to spend it
on the
thinking more about features that we actually do want but
oh by the agenda items nine for after the meeting because we are meeting time is run and somebody else you gotta use this round and you know we can't hang out here yeah matter this so
okay what do this little will take for lunch break okay then uh we can discuss for the more
okay with our ideas and again that talking
no
so thanks for coming and uh i sentiments of meeting and uh please which are all information in the selling folder so everybody can share information
okay
so let's go for instance
i agree very much
oh
okay
yeah
yeah
oh come back
hope to light
i hope were already good lunch
yeah
so
uh this meeting may i can tell she uh to discuss about the
conceptual
design meeting
okay
and uh agenda will be
don't want me i and uh that uh
the product manager or secretary that's me and the the presentations from the christy
and uh
i notice
and then you see here
finally in this meeting we have to decide
and you know to take a decision on the remote control
concepts
and uh
the functional design
so we all forty minutes
i think it's uh
it could be uh you know but i i hope we can finish it up
so i'll hand go to uh
the functionality into the christine we're here to discuss about uh the components
concept
okay
so uh if you could open the powerpoint presentation
and number two
two
components design
so uh could put in slide show oh yeah
right here
is that little that one yes please thank you
yes
so why um
and we were looking specifically at the components uh the following components
uh the case the power supply
uh means of communications with the television set
and then since we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition you have to have a microphone well in a dementia haven't
have to have microphone in the device
but um
maybe you didn't have it
a way has to has to hear the speaker
and um so it could be the television set could be in the device but somewhere you have
put the microphone
um and or a way of making beeps or sounds you can find it when it gets lost
um so the other thing that we
so
a method for
going about this is we've looked at uh at the store the historical record what's worked with hasn't
and then we also were um
the wind evaluates a new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because
course we
might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies capabilities to offer us so uh this is the approach that we took during our um her research
so um for the case
um we told we were making this best case specific assumption that it would be curved in design course no i wanted it to be expand the ball end shrink a_b_l but
uh and that doesn't seem to be one of the choice not an option we can
we can really seriously explore
so then we were thinking about um rubber but um
and fortunately has been limited because of the heat uh factor and then um there might be some
problems with than uh how it's
that goes with the board
uh and uh then plastic also has this problem melting and is brittle i guess brittle after a while so um still had titanium in in word available
but um and fortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh than people in manufacturing said that could make it curved cases that have titanium although
how
apple did it with with
powerbook i'm not quite sure but
uh nevertheless so um they've eliminated all of our options except wide
so
this is
and it is she said it's an environmentally friendly uh material so
were were
ling proposed thing
i will get to my personal preferences in just a second
so this this other matter of the chips and them well we could use a simple design on the board but
uh the simple chips but that's only works for the bayes you don't get very much um intelligence with the simple one
and um then that was their regular which
i regret that i've forgotten exactly
why i'm eliminating that one
uh the other option was this advanced chip-on-print
and uh we like we we found
uh it it includes is infrared sender which would never the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip
and uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip-on-print so
uh would we uh
now jumping right to our personal preferences
well um yeah i really think we should you know use some of us some really exotic words
like um you know
uh well you guys come from tropical countries so you can can think of some trees and some nice words
i think that
people who might really want to design their own cases you see they could do sort of a this um three dimensional design on the internet and then they could submit their borders can like you similar custom car order you know and you can choose the color of the size of the wheels and the colors of the leather and things like that and then i uh i think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip
so this is the findings so far research and my recommendations
uh for the new remote control um would be to have um
have been made out of wood
many problems with that
can you go back uh one slide
i'm not sure how well i know this let's go back up here this uh
of course change uh
what's mean exactly i want to see
well
brain functioning okay
i think it's um that um i'm multiple uh chip design
um in it so maybe printed onto the circuit board
uh i could find out more about that was there before the next fit next meeting is it'll look like was like also restore uh
i don't know but i'll find out more next week a little bit would be good so the finder mode but modified to remove this so that would be cool sounds good
remove the plastic going into those are possible to because um
it gets brutal
cracks
um
and um
we want we expect these um
and these remote controls to be around for several hundred years
so
yeah
it it
expression expression
well after us
cool
i don't speak for yourself i will
oh
i think with a window you run into the same types of problems with me i mean it chat said if you drop but
it's i'm not sure
yeah
see other comments actually read it is
yeah but i think in the cell if you use really good quality work that it might work but you can't just you know
i don't see where julia making use of the words are hard text yeah that way but there's some very creative output
um actually very innovative idea
okay go ahead
so we are having a hard time keeping remote control of my uh it's
it's actually a very innovative different idea that uh you you can choose your color would
the type who
um
staying means each person getting other personalized individualized
speech recognition remote control in what
it's
not on the market
slightly too easily slide the the design the functional design uh what would you do
um
in terms of comments on this article users my only as well
oh moments closed
she works in the cubicle next to me so she's actually was already a little bit prepared for this uh
not that we add what's now i'd i wouldn't
yeah
yeah
helping get the quality materials and then
it shouldn't influence the design principles to match which you'll see with my presentation one thing we have to check those with the users whether
how quickly the novelty wears off and not having you would have to have splinters in your yeah value for example
so
have to see how
kid friendly and it's and
and all that but
so like if your dog gets a hold of it they can use it
i
for t. thing
i did a with rubber plastic so
yeah they do it with
and materials as well yeah
which are more
okay then uh let's move to uh i mean
sure
no possibility
so
okay so
so it's a very short presentations i'm actually gonna try the layout on the board so
if you wanna just go straight to the second slide
uh which basically shows sort of i took the ideas that we're talking about last time
um and try to put that
into the remote controls the things that you can actually see on it are the on off switch
volume and channel control the menu access button
ergonomic shape which i completely agree with kristen's idea to have it sort of moulded so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the standard very straight remote controls
actually everything with the word if we take your customizing idea
is that people can actually do sort of quality measurements on their hand size of someone has larger hand my innocence why different size on your for example
so that's a really good idea estimate customize ability
um one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen i just like you have on flip phones
so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally pressed her hand on especially if you have little kids around they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch t_v sharon accidentally change the channel or during um
and also
i had issues of the batteries running at so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life like
on it that kind of goes domain dimmer and dimmer as your batteries starts to die
and in terms of invisible features audio and um tactile feedback on button classes um um and like you said speech recognition
so in terms of uh what
they might actually look like
despite working in interface design not very sorry as well so you have to forgive me
we'll have something like this well
on off switch fairly dave
sort of in a corner and by itself
so you don't accidentally turn your t_v off either transmit over the buttons
and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays
or
channels
and volume
so the for surfing channels and then volumes of volume maybe the up and down
volume goes up and down and then channel structure right
and then here you have your sort of standard
telephone ish
number
and then on one side you would have access to the menu
on your t_v
and on the other side
a way to turn off the voice control
so that if the user doesn't want to use their voice they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control on accidentally
changing things on it
um so you could have a little else you write somewhere
i fly
and
right
i don't know
so as you can see it's a very very simple design which is one of the things i really wanted to keep
keep it simple not have too many buttons not have too many functionalities turn into it
i think the design can pretty much carry over to everything although with the with the flip-screen
like you have to do something slightly
hinge
we lack of copper and show yeah we just have to start watching of in a way it's depending on how much the the flip-screen why it away from
um i don't know control going to start getting to her
but that's the general layout with the general functionalities
or something else
as you can see there's a lot of space out there for a remote control
and if you to customize it maybe
we can make this thing fairly small uh college
no no no
personal preferences
so
that's pretty much
all i had to say i mean everything else in terms of design issues
i mean the centering of the keypad and
the channel is just depending on where your thumb is
and you tend to use the the volume control and uh
the browsing more than the actual number pad so that would be sort of interactive liner for your thumb goes when you hold in your remote control
the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently um um
so once we decide exactly what we want then we can figure out the exact positioning
but more or less it could you go along those lines
so what's your uh
comments or uh
simple design
so customers want
okay
sounds like he's too and we have a product here
yeah
probably is obviously going to cost
um
okay i also
very simple
presentation is cut from a marketing point you have to see what the consumers want
also uh
copied uh
different type of remote
if you
finally
alright that
i shall we wanted here
but
try
much
sure
so be modified
we still go for it
my name is simple
questionnaires in different areas because there was obviously we have to see whether congress consumers are looking for today access uh trends change very very quickly
and six months maybe this idea has already gone out the window so it's gonna question how fast we can act
uh they already are stressed or mael
no
go to find almost no
so we go to
uh market train
this is what we know from the last uh from them
questionnaires and level although servers with the fancy feel good that's what we were looking for something that feels good in the hand that's easy to use
looking for next generation of innovation because all the remotes out there now are all very similar they all do the same thing
yet or something completely
okay
easy to use as always become has become a another major interest that uh
with the whiteboard we can see two more that's easy to use
and i think this is another thing is interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting cell technology
so even if we are product that may be more expensive
if it comes out right
if i didn't look at looks and feels good and has technology
the second two you can see the last one is a very easy simple design
the second one there's about uh uh forty five thousand different buttons on it which makes it fairly hard to read per i do use the first one i see
but they put in the display
or something else and with a little flip-open wearing what kinds of things simple way to flip-open table display on the flip-open one close and everything's locked
yeah
maybe the display also makes it easier to use because sometimes a new looking for buttons maybe if you see a display
context sensitive instructions
oh okay ending a much better but no the t_v or the davey d. or something else i've seen specially mostly the standard really sounding speech alienation yeah you have one with a very simple also the idea is simple but with the display
so you could see what you're doing
so maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use
trendy fancy
feels good
uh
with the display
would designer would design a colors
yeah maybe magic a day or so
somebody waters the device
the kids send them like um
he and
uh
some sort of a phone rubber
um
paul yeah and then they would squeeze it would take the shape of their hand yeah so it's really molded to his ears were sitting there and then you would know like
um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh core the screen
the reason
i don't really
right
but that for that you gotta do sort of an average across families and that's right and so you would not less than everyone has their own personal remote that that actually went to increase the um the resonator
yeah
to to
no but incorporating the three uh
obviously be something totally new on the market
yeah
totally different
for already the customize ability is
really good sort of
when you get with the uh result nokia the chemo
changeable covers
um yeah taking marking for another phase to get off the ground of difference
and and that's my soul millions
millions
so
so with of the findings when the research is easy to use something totally new
we had come up with something totally new that's not
we also have to work um consider that to who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes to my
one and learn about um labor laws
you know in different countries and stuff with so we can do it cheap but don't want to exploit uh labor in um
third world countries
to actually return it you turn around and say that you're um part of the reason the cost is high for the devices because
um you're paying yeah a working wage to the person who made
the device
but we can get a production in uh
countries like uh custom anyways yeah yes and just like in your chain or a male she also
you can build better futures and butterflies and you can some more
so
that would that be something that manufacturing would have to
yeah um
yeah explore more and and to where where manufacturers is
none of the stuff
yeah we're here to design
yes uh but uh that's the problem i can talk about the production later on it depends on the the quantity of the um um so we don't need to have a only one uh fabric factory or something so we can have a carpeted room
the through the fabric okay with the different uh electronics items then we can have it
business trial i tilde quite the cost
to some more
so
but to let let's decide first about uh components concept and uh interface concept
we could use
except for for what of you what uh it was talking
and your design
with uh you wanted the display or the don't display or just a simple so
i think it depends i mean i think it's a good idea but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the t_v you already have
a big display right in front of you
um
so
if we're trying to keep costs down
then maybe sacrificing the display
um
is a way to go i mean depends on how much putting a display cost and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for and um 'cause if it's only used for one little thing than putting in a big display case for a big display that's
probably expensive just to do the training on the chair
for the speech recognition or whatever
may not be the most cost efficient way to go but
that's just sort of speculation i mean
would you think engine
you like the display and one of the concepts that you show
um you know how much it costs uh
um
to to add a little display like this right
so
when taken action items or find out
it's
as we have to find out cost or
okay
sorry about that last no problem i'm here from pushing it after it's made
our market
once we get a price on them
marketing
so
the advanced chip-on-print is but um
well we've
but we decide
we've determined in the uh
engineering industrial design is the recommendation
and um i think we've kind of come to some
agreement regarding um
this concept of a wooden case
yeah
a customizable and
nice
good thing how do what about you will but this will
with the buttons we went to uh
uh i don't think so so now i think they could be rubber glacier now so you have that old had little experience of
yeah so
well what we'll do is uh we'll we'll stick with uh the simple design for time being until uh i find notes about uh how much it's cost of extra in case people for the display
okay so maybe what you can do is um both of you can come up with uh
the prototype
both people more than okay
okay
sure
so well um
are we done this mean
uh i hope of is it okay uh they will have come up with the prototype design
okay then they can show you how it looks like and then we can uh submit to the
i would submit to the management
okay
and in that time you can come with a price how much it's cost is extra for the the display
and i'm marketing strategy distributed extra curricular
on the fire
you can tell extra
of course you make money total so
followed by you make when it will your commission
okay so any questions
so by next meeting so please come up with uh the prototype
okay and uh then we can proceed from here
okay
oh
so thanks for all your efforts
and coming for the meeting again
and see you soon
okay okay thank you
so um
yeah
yeah
the reader delay
s.
well my everybody
sure
i see
so this meeting agenda we do today
design meeting
and uh
opening the p. of the second of the me minutes uh prototype presentation from uh the steve
yeah
i need
phones
yes same the evaluation criteria yeah
the finance uh it's uh from my side from the management and the production evaluation
then uh closing so we have forty minutes
to discuss
and uh finalize and
close
dot product project
i didn't for that
so
okay let's talk about uh maybe first uh
the prototype
yeah okay
so and and or to
i don't know presentation but it pretty much covers work that we have done so
if i'm missing anything extension gently writings me to do
yeah
okay go to
yeah my
it's not the biggest powerpoint presentation oh
so you two or three or three
i don't think it's the last one called
uh huh
no
then this is like look at that
final design
yeah it is named appropriately it is conceded
um okay okay
yes
it's
alright so
from them when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting we decided that we wanted ergonomic shaped material that we chose was wait
and that the color would be customizable you can staying away
whatever color
um
so in terms of function yeah to be able to turn the t_v on and off volume and channel control menu control voice recognition control
and we've incorporated the l. c. d. screen on the flat panel as part of the design if we figure out it's too expensive problems to get
um so
turn pale
ah level products
this is
our remote control
with the flat panel as you can see
so if you left that
the panel
you can save that lovely yellow l. c. d. display
um
so actually part of the of the yellow button you have is the on-off button so it's really big hard to mess
you have the
the red um
triangles of the toggles or
changing the volume up
volume up down volume down
the green are the channel changing
then that's when i was very light very touchable displays
and then you have the numeric pad
in the dark blue at the bottom
and so on
the right hand side you have
the access to the menu on the t_v and on the left hand side
he had uh
he
the the ability to turn off the voice recognition
so this is pretty much what we had on the whiteboard the last time
um and uh it's
yeah additional feature on the back
as you can have your own customized
backing and i suppose you could do the same thing on the flat case on the front
so that you can really make this a highly highly customizable remote control
we haven't uh um
uh specified where the speaker where the microphone will be placed
that depends um the design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left
um yeah
i think the microphone is on the top
oh yes okay though
mid of late
so that would be the save
so
when it the chip
it's not on the chip because you need to have my
followed system it depends on the design of the circuit board
yes there shouldn't be under the p_l_p either because you can have the remote control close but you still might want to
well that's activated by voice yeah but uh
my opinion i think it's but on the flip because when all you want to
the topic okay so then you can speak then you can close it
but if you put it on the on the fly for k. then uh
technical uh i don't think it's a feasible
because most of the time you speak then it will be recognized if you've already got the remote control your hand need to open the flip to use the voice why use the voice why not just use your hand
i mean the whole point of the voice is that of the remote control is sitting there and i'm too lazy to reach over and pick it out
i can just use my voice the gap my hand in the popcorn bowl and um holding my cup of coca cola and the other hand
yeah
we don't wanna like go by the robot
okay
i mean it doesn't have to be on the flip it can be on the side of my exercise i smoothing his work so that's great so i mean i can pass around it
yes it's on wednesday
yeah then replace them with a napkin
i see
this paper microphone on the side i would have you probably would have been a bit a missionary thing to be accessed um all the time to voice
yeah exactly
so it's been doing
so um
couple most of the artist
it's um
you just work on the wait a little bit
yes
yeah maybe the shape of the buttons the little um so it takes shape silence
domestic and sadness past looks more heavily but uh ten minutes compared to the other demon bits of less weight
i mean this is faster saying there's only so much you can do it we could have possibly made a lot thinner as well
but
part of the thing is
a lot of people say that they don't like something that's to lie because they don't feel like they have enough control over it
i mean maybe this is excessively happy
i think he needs to have some way he needs to feel like you're still holding something
so that's pretty much it for a presentation actually or replied more that
yeah that's good
thank you are much
so any comments or uh
the prototype uses rule within this on it i'd use it
talked about the previous meetings
they'll goes to his next phrases financial
yes the uh to uh
so i'd come back to uh
so evaluation criteria i think uh that would be good
so
let's come to the finance i have some uh calculations which are made uh as further
the budget
so here you can look like uh the energy source and uh hand dynamo and the kinetic and solar cells
uh put optional somewhat option there and at once the chip-on-print that's what uh we were talking about that
so
then we have sample sensor information speaker
then there are complementary
then special color
i'd push-button
so it uh actual our budget was uh twelve point five euro but uh it's coming to nine point nine four euros so we are and uh below the budget
okay so still saving some money
i think it's a good figure
yes for me
nice
congratulations should well we haven't got the mic yet so
anyone enveloping it does cut the cost one way to market it is it
maybe it's for some money we can utilize for order uh marketing
the say it's okay and uh
which is the pens are already
well on this
problem
version or a cost analysis we do not have an l. c. display
l. c. display is gonna be very expensive can do
but it's not filled in style does will have the present yeah yeah yeah okay sorry
so if we add the r. personally to the three year old
paul
or remote
now are up around about twelve tall and a half
as to what
uh the company
had initially requested
so that means we can put the uh this billions billion
this first
production uh line putting about question because we're talking about profit also
uh mine you'll see uh
the problem with uh our survey that the possibility of how many units can be sold what percentage of the market et cetera cetera because at all this has to be taken it
into consideration
uh this is just production cost it is not uh advertising cost is not transportation cost uh
is still there we had to one point they have will inflate yes
quite a bit
the cost of the cost of the unit
for the company
so to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million
oh
profit
really like it
this we are talking about one unit functions of an input into the quantity
okay
and the cost will come down
slide both customization because this is being them in an though on on order basis might be uh that the quantities from one drive the circuit board will be right would be produced in quantity but the cost of the case would uh
can be fixed in the
uh you get some pretty cheap labor they can do this case for one euro
x. files really that's the course material analytical
it's really
stan
thing
but anyway still we are under control okay so what uh i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors will people get uh
the production cost less okay so that we can save some money
okay to put in with our marketing more uh we know the promotions whatever
okay
so that uh i would look often i speak to the management in the computation of some more uh
postamble
if we can go to to my display
i will come back to yours
is just to give
everybody an idea of the market
it's now scare everybody out of this project
yeah
if i'm still here person or persons yeah
you will
yeah
four gives me is gonna be trendwatch
it's the same way you did before
it should be
and uh soft right now
yeah
that's not the same when you have to go back and find another one
whatever name
popped up
uh uh functional try functional might not be even normalcy
i'm excited there
yep that's it so color screen by screen
oh no
since so we need to have some trouble ideal market uh we had independent status is that there's this market has availability um so what we'd need the million units per year
okay
our internal company evaluation puts a between eighty nine million which is approximately same as independence day
um so if we continue
and look at the findings
next screen
which means that uh we have a target of two million with the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year
which is actually a tremendous amount
i'm not keeping
no kidding
yeah maybe they already expect so if we put an inflated price of fifty euro or production cost they cannot exceed
twenty five euro okay we're already in yeah there
price
okay we transport
promotion labor because we only included the promotion the cost
um transport for the material to the stores or whatever our home over break this down between our
our retailers
twenty five percent of the market to get to two million units or two main units we have to have a profit of twenty five euro per unit to get to the fifty million you need your profit
yep
okay
so
obviously remember i just to to bring down the evaluation before
the phase uh fancy stylish and most of the of the you know the ease of use
speech recognition
cost we've gone through these know companies most evaluated
the feasibility would be able to take enough of the market
to justify in production
what we project is over two euros
but be that the market changes very very quickly maybe there's no more interesting by this thing in eighteen months from
so we know we have to move decision
can the company still to me in your answer
can select
for fifty euros canonical findings
um
i would uh like to explore the possibility of using an alternative
um delivery in sales channel which would be um to use the internet i was thinking the thing for promotion and ordering and then to drop ship the product to the customers residents that we have no storage yet no um you do have transportation instead of the labor cost which you don't have the transport to the
um point of sale yes yeah point of sale is online
yeah you do shopping center somewhere
or strategically placed shopping centers rather minimize
that's on syntax should sell through m. s. on january bill very well yeah yeah
as an idea i'm going to work uh um
to find more fulfilled and upscale technology uh what you are selling your uh
unique products uh
and actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customizable 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have
see maybe what other people have done one the range of possibilities that whereas if you're in a store
you can't
unless you're highly imaginative
person and you may not really know what it is you want whereas on the web if you have a bunch of pictures it can serve trigger ideas and
and you can even have a in a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the uh oh i think you're missing really is the the way you wanted to the feel of the product
but
we're getting used to then it's not quite like trying on issue but
people are getting used to buying things online they can't touch
before running down through with the watches too you can customize what you can see how it is that's the end of the production you can change it uh
is it what a long way it is doing this now
you wrote to look on it and look this way
as possible do this maybe there's a possibility of something more than two minute someone you wish
she's believe feasibility uh
well the price um
okay
right
and in this uh the only one that uh
okay then uh let's wait for the production okay then uh you can evaluate the product so it looks like technically in the room
uh have you
what turnaround time do we have
can you production evaluation can you were very very quick or very rarely so it's it's really great
of course it will uh come back into weeks
we would include
for for me evolution okay
prototypes you mean
yes the hand um neural product evaluation
well should do some market tests uh once we have prototypes into some borders and things like that in
test marketed
through another marker for people to do indeed do this we gave them in give you will make some form it's minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use
it's not trivial talk because we are we are not going to do to know all quality okay so we can no no for what we definitely shouldn't do it you attribute
so go to the uh other place
and i don't think it's take more than problems time
okay so that's uh real production will be installed once we product evaluation
okay been yeah
for example from uh
the technical team and uh
your team
okay
from the management
the meeting
uh
okay
any outstanding
so any any other uh questions or uh comments to be
this goes
no huh
i think we've very much covered everything
okay so they do have something i just wondering about if we're gonna do product evaluation and what about time for a redesign
if
the users come back and tell us no this is bad this is bad we want this done differently
okay uh
let's take like this let's proceed with this model okay for the for the
market introduction okay so no more changes would be made okay
in this
the basic design
okay
we will introduce this modern-day and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers then
we can uh go for the
second generation evolution
okay
there's not and there's no limit
the problem is there'll be no is like a generation of the first generation of logs for some silly reason
get a customer ahead they'll they'll idea
the other one taste
okay so that is annoying
there's no limit
no but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine tune just to
and general range of requirements versus releasing a product that
we think will work but we don't really have anything to language specific
yeah so that's the reason we are here for uh the design
okay i hope everybody has little and i'm not
everybody i mean the whole point um user evaluation is to see what real people need we have our own motivations in mind we have around ideas in mind but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell
yeah but uh see we oughta take a few consideration so can only the price consideration one of the few to consideration okay like uh you can you tell you cannot do it more like a need more chilly okay
so it depends on the individual taste
you know so we have we had to balance somewhere
yeah of course i'm just trying to point out that i think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is to
sure you have no redesign not you personally but
yeah and the product would have i dunno doesn't
redesign timing it
yeah
do you know what season of the year time of the year is the most important for t_v remote control sales
would be the christmas season by any chance the sports time sports sees
right before which is boards all hope
only
so soccer's maybe those the we've already have been involved occupied needed to be
we can remote control
so i think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronize the final though the launch of a user tested device with some special event yeah that's a good idea and then um so that gives us a little more time perhaps than we anticipated because
i don't know when the world cup is but i'm sure there's gonna be one major sport
oh another market major sports event probably not the um the football games coming at the end of january i think that might be a little too aggressive yeah uh but
so i'm just take a pointing out uh uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing the press and then to lunch
um added a major sports event or uh perhaps to uh i was still in place to advertise that tivo and to work with motion pictures and there might be some motion picture that are coming out
um when they're coming out on d. v. d. that uh they need to have an special remote control to work with it so we could maybe work out campaign with uh with sony pictures for example maybe some management has got
have relationships there we can average yes uh that of course uh i'm convinced amounting to do that
that's great
there's just something to keep in mind is this really really avoid a lot of products have gone out there without being properly user test that i completely flopped when in fact it gets re released a few years down the line that with proper testing it takes off like crazy
disposable diapers is an example of that in fact i think it has started it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years there was a disposable consumer product
and uh
people in the market
hadn't really
gotten onto the concept that you could use something and then throw it away because it wasn't there
but then when they re launched in thirty years later they were virtually the same design but people had gotten throw away you know paper caps and map get all kinds of things that
they hadn't um so yeah you're right timing is very important but i think we've got a good product
yeah the cities and areas user that's right from what uh the brand value
on the program
it's gonna be very important to the company
we were behind the scene and he's uh friends clean so yeah
you know the history
i don't like it
good luck
good luck
marketer uh
you look very relaxed be considering you know the uh
straight
others yeah
okay so then uh let's come to uh closing recently costs within the budget
and uh is the project evaluated okay so that will uh come so
okay for the but there are time being so tags for all your efforts and play pool okay in the great design
and the let's leave it to the act later for once production is
four and the minute i met some folks
so let's meta uh this evening to handle
closer working
sounds good good banking nice working with your data
thank you
i think a good quality
yeah
i see on the input layer is only used the wrong
oh
um
or what
in
uh huh
yeah
