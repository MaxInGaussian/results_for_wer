<s> education </s>
<s> had cats </s>
<s> oh sorry </s>
<s> how we placed in terms of uh </s>
<s> sorry </s>
<s> yeah okay it's it's comfortable yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yes slash probably try substrate actually pull out a little different from each applicant yeah that's get okay </s>
<s> and they got pensions while time </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> figments phone calls </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> it's well </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> only hard to drink coffee </s>
<s> and uh </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> are you critical </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> oh god </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> right so you just do this to this powerpoint clockwork </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> how're point </s>
<s> very efficient yeah well </s>
<s> it's it's it's </s>
<s> hm yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> 'kay this kind of getting into it </s>
<s> right um </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> just pick up the meeting basically um so we're working now for real reaction this is i've so </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> scum agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting about um </s>
<s> good and just do a quick opening the making of we all get acquainted with one another um the word start talk a little bit about tool training essentially that means getting used to </s>
<s> the only thing that we haven't tried out yet the whiteboard </s>
<s> um we've got a general plan for the project how are gonna go about accomplishing this and then just the discussion and close up </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> ah oh </s>
<s> because you know </s>
<s> gave aside um in real life um so yeah </s>
<s> basically it </s>
<s> i would like to and just go there you get of course you can discuss i'm thinking about um </s>
<s> proposing that </s>
<s> since we've got this weird blend of </s>
<s> our selves in our roles </s>
<s> that we just don't have to do to help </s>
<s> um so um if you say something about marketing right sorted um is gonna be easy to go from like exactly the kind of um and the other day if you guys at the same time if you like logically something that's of economic </s>
<s> we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of the paper book you know </s>
<s> you select well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because the backs obviously go with it </s>
<s> um and we'll discuss it but </s>
<s> i'm not gonna ask you know that </s>
<s> or is in the upper right </s>
<s> yeah yeah yeah exactly so </s>
<s> because world war sort of role playing see agree are you gonna tap into your own knowledge as well </s>
<s> um that's the same for your when we do introductions i mean um </s>
<s> and you talk about your background you have fine you make your way to um </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> you know maybe it you're like me like u. c. s. b. but you might say you want to hire or something like that one i know you can </s>
<s> this is i guess you can have a little the phone itself </s>
<s> it has a curve that does that seem logical </s>
<s> oh yeah it's </s>
<s> she actually so </s>
<s> cool </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> i guess they did </s>
<s> we're totally </s>
<s> we're making a remote control which is thrilling 'em </s>
<s> uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model and if you guys had time to check the inner life out of you guess it did checked the um </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> the corporate website um we've got </s>
<s> to make something as fashionable as possible that's kind of the corporate strategies we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to </s>
<s> make it nice you know like journalist nicer you know if you go to damage or something </s>
<s> so um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> we're gonna go about doing that is basically the first we're gonna start on the basics and that's running need you guys user interface designer is in the um </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> the </s>
<s> other designer that i can't remember the </s>
<s> the idea of the u. i. d. right oh </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> the industrial designer hey </s>
<s> finally getting into it </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> to guide me and guidance on this project 'cause you're gonna be you get you guys at the bottom you know you like no you can't do that you can't have you know x. and y. um at the same time </s>
<s> and then um </s>
<s> or that from what is necessary to more like </s>
<s> what would be 'til it </s>
<s> you know like um </s>
<s> i think yes but at the same the mouse i did but the idea of um </s>
<s> yes a coffee pipe needs to be able to hold coffee </s>
<s> yeah but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that if you touch your head or something like that </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and so will work out from there and um then we learned talk about and then finally what </s>
<s> incorporate as kind of the last taken away you guys build there are tell me tell us what's possible and you tell </s>
<s> as what we can </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> hope for in what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer in that of all this the uh the u. i. d. and the idea you know you can keep on the recording at the cutting edge of how to get about maximizing what is possible </s>
<s> um to kind of sink it all up </s>
<s> so that's a detailed design so it's a three state kind of thing </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> right so for now just for the with the whiteboard um </s>
<s> basically i just i_i's do it i haven't tried it yet either </s>
<s> um i'm just gonna start um don't need to carry like five remotes around </s>
<s> um and </s>
<s> just write down on the scanner either one of the names of my um </s>
<s> there's a disk you know if you if you were trapped on it as a violin you can only bring five c. d.s along with your name one of them that you could not all five if you wanna a five go for it but in one of them that you could </s>
<s> um i'll </s>
<s> we skip interactions </s>
<s> nice </s>
<s> and the pixel project manager </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> hi marty </s>
<s> i don't know what you uni uh he uses santa barbara that you're working on a p. h. d. in psychology </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> um sarah i went to michigan and now here in cultural studies </s>
<s> and i'm marketing manager something marketing expert expert templates up there are plans for i think </s>
<s> um run uh once upon a time studied in victoria </s>
<s> and i and um the </s>
<s> user interface design </s>
<s> and then from </s>
<s> california indicating uh </s>
<s> my screen such a thought </s>
<s> but you get you need and you set up a comment about augusta </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> right so it doesn't island yes </s>
<s> to to do if you write it down or you tell us well you know you are just gonna a couple of it </s>
<s> yeah the music anything as i'm assuming everybody likes meetings or some lesser or greater extent but for some other options if your t_v </s>
<s> s_l_t like i am mikes model fairly well oh some of it is rubbish but i went to high school tumbling actually </s>
<s> i got </s>
<s> the the make the guy laugh yeah </s>
<s> is your major yeah </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> very much step </s>
<s> hell a soccer player but a total bastard modules really tall like he's got sick so he's a big guy </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> uh okay so </s>
<s> i really like getting back way </s>
<s> 'cause in department </s>
<s> ooh </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> as though as like the remaining will have </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and um blow up a mess of rubber interested in there um </s>
<s> you can't are operating some income </s>
<s> okay so it really works just like a pain only makes noise the thing </s>
<s> it's kinda weird interesting yeah yeah like present gospel </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> you see </s>
<s> alright so um what was it a mexican right dancing television watcher </s>
<s> whatever you want </s>
<s> i guess i'll can extend further </s>
<s> okay well it is all in light </s>
<s> one of the um yeah okay </s>
<s> basically isn't hand right </s>
<s> oh okay </s>
<s> volume on channel easily </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> right now all i'm listening to the uh </s>
<s> similar growl </s>
<s> press that gate militia in </s>
<s> posted a nice uh really lame </s>
<s> and uh </s>
<s> i know </s>
<s> i didn't really </s>
<s> probably classical totally you okay yeah uh i mean </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> um and make it with a these well you had only to read that and then i'll family guy is it is it did you watch the new season no one </s>
<s> are you get it online or is it gonna start downloading it yeah </s>
<s> anything that is </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> most of the on the </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> oh wow </s>
<s> yeah oh man train at our readers upgradable </s>
<s> uh for big orchestra </s>
<s> yeah there are two reasons i dislike fruity numbers </s>
<s> for fun </s>
<s> um and open your the concert in belgium </s>
<s> that was exciting </s>
<s> i was having a ten </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> thing i love about ever </s>
<s> and i think those </s>
<s> it </s>
<s> action into powerpoint </s>
<s> okay i designed specifically to ignore ideas to build just the five by five i can read that much </s>
<s> uh yes yes it's okay or </s>
<s> well it </s>
<s> that's probably yeah uh excel horrible i've seen more you're in in this industry before previously </s>
<s> i just came from glasgow uh </s>
<s> happy to say that there's there's a say you would contribute approximately </s>
<s> it's a whole meeting in </s>
<s> it really should be so </s>
<s> does uh </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> right yeah </s>
<s> huh </s>
<s> hm meeting in nice </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i'm going to land in there you don't work will have to be here for three years some of the thing that the terminology right </s>
<s> i've already got more than i can keep track of my i'm gonna go next weekend and make my guide you to close your home yet now they'll be like </s>
<s> so you something british you like i'll shut up in normal uh it should be interesting </s>
<s> yeah i mean i tell not coming back </s>
<s> yeah uh i'll </s>
<s> you see gonna stay here </s>
<s> probably read these get a work visa for a while and then decide </s>
<s> 'kay relative yeah indices are a blessing to yeah yeah </s>
<s> uh yeah i think it's still the other one well yeah that's why it's how we're yeah </s>
<s> something in this stuff and i'll </s>
<s> i miss coffee right in his body </s>
<s> uh uh cost less than oh yeah to to maintain sorta like we're working from in california but i'd rather say you did what you uh um </s>
<s> why uh he ever said it would be achieved </s>
<s> yeah oh really uh and muslims insertion scraps </s>
<s> can't </s>
<s> well i want something out for myself to see going to certain ignore account sorry you </s>
<s> you just can't get a better riedel's kilohertz and set it up </s>
<s> it's safer 'cause ascended here </s>
<s> this was his or her general </s>
<s> probably harvesting </s>
<s> it must make all the difference yeah i would not </s>
<s> he's </s>
<s> it does other things to this you just can't places like uh whatever the school and you deserve our decided on top </s>
<s> the mexican food is okay </s>
<s> it's not good </s>
<s> like a yeah like two bucks like where the tool box </s>
<s> mismatch right i guess yeah </s>
<s> good call </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> where you from sending you </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> just literally just measure all this a rather like furniture zero okay so nevada's </s>
<s> right yeah i got canceled on </s>
<s> thirty second they've </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> close uh your client half shop is by university yeah imports yeah yeah it's actually like literally happen often </s>
<s> that's cool yeah variable small </s>
<s> yeah as we were discussing before </s>
<s> no more of the same </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> general radio </s>
<s> right so okay success on the whiteboard you can harness your answer now a little bit infections we talked about summer season </s>
<s> things we like about seeing the whole thing go </s>
<s> uh right so we want to not find stuff other project finance </s>
<s> um basically what we're trying to do this eligible for twenty five euros </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> this is what the finance department is told me the c. f. l. but i don't now </s>
<s> i'm not sold on this is pretty dire i mean </s>
<s> twenty </s>
<s> that's like you know forty bucks for a remote you would have to </s>
<s> pretty much like you might wanna reform it too i'm so what we can maybe work on that later but we're gonna make a one and the proper names make fifty million euros on your internationally so </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> one of things that i was gonna mention to get the designers is that </s>
<s> um it um we probably need a river it needs to be a universal remote control probably okay um so something that could do in t. s. c. as well as pile as well as various other formats like it's gonna control the disease but um you know only lets you guys but that's something that is gonna be international sort of thing </s>
<s> um one try to make it for twelve fifty </s>
<s> so we wanna try to make a hundred percent half an hour if we can't </s>
<s> um 's right so i'm just the close up i'm not sure how much time ideas and extract right project manager </s>
<s> sort of </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> he's i will need another half an hour or so um </s>
<s> and i like the um industrial then you get to think about what needs to be done like what the basic function of it </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> you i'd be </s>
<s> well yeah you're right good your time is up there you also get assignments from in your email as well more sparse specifics on what to do </s>
<s> um basically and so indeed you tell us what um </s>
<s> we what the users want to look at so </s>
<s> actually the way you guys </s>
<s> could maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the users gonna want and what the user can have you know like um associate </s>
<s> yeah well it is a little more discuss the trade offs in between um and so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your e-mail </s>
<s> but i i think that that is more or less a good place to start from now um and he's more things come up will have a meeting in </s>
<s> the emails and so forth </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> any questions before we get started </s>
<s> i assume they were building a standalone uh remote control </s>
<s> we can't to kind of build it into other </s>
<s> uh product's </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> you mean the lawyer instance like a mobile phone </s>
<s> 'cause </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> hm sounds interesting </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i don't think there's any roles about it yet another personal coach will </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> word works you know say can we pretty can we sell of </s>
<s> remote control phone for twenty five pounds </s>
<s> well have a think about it i mean again i'm i'm certainly open it seems like yeah it seems like it certainly doable isn't it </s>
<s> i mean um </s>
<s> or if we can't have a for mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function </s>
<s> the clap and i mean it can be no good idea gonna go see visually </s>
<s> every remote changeable faces like face they can buy for uh like uh i dunno like that part </s>
<s> huh </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> it's true i guess we will probably have some time maybe we should bring server below what we wanna do </s>
<s> go back to um </s>
<s> oh really haven't let me bring up something about </s>
<s> our basic goals here what we want to </s>
<s> accomplish </s>
<s> uh project and out's but </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> oh really </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> not so much </s>
<s> from </s>
<s> i will find him or her own </s>
<s> now we also discussing her initial ideas yeah yeah that's still it's still </s>
<s> so you wake up and initial ideas </s>
<s> i'm going to take notes on this to this </s>
<s> get any </s>
<s> step two minutes yeah oh never um </s>
<s> its initial ideas </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> looks pretty much again it's gonna be universal </s>
<s> yeah we'd said that already </s>
<s> and it need the function for other things as you said there's like all the other things you can't remote'll like your microwave or a friend you are like </s>
<s> ten evident but then </s>
<s> never been a fan those huge remotes that have like a million buttons you can't and within this followers that are simple </s>
<s> completely specific </s>
<s> oh thinking </s>
<s> kind of p. d. a. uh </s>
<s> design so touch screen design </s>
<s> rather than one house so that you can kind of you sitting around all sorts of different things </s>
<s> yeah that's like he's and it i mean my </s>
<s> step best yeah they deserve yeah </s>
<s> so we got five minutes more to chapter us perfect </s>
<s> um so that is kind of an idea of a trade off between um </s>
<s> uh size and functionality </s>
<s> oh yeah we also the month multi-functional but at the same time it against you too much you not leave all the teller parts and it's you complicated yeah check out of the buttons </s>
<s> things </s>
<s> i was gonna node </s>
<s> for future reference this idea uh um </s>
<s> so you like in the black and out like a touch screen type of remote and um </s>
<s> possible </s>
<s> i don't think well in this option to get it needs one outstanding feature set apart from all the average yeah all the other universal remotes </s>
<s> um i don't know if there's such thing up there i guess we'll do some do some research on or whatever screw some research on it about whether or not there are um ortiz format </s>
<s> like um </s>
<s> you know how in the icsi region one </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> pretty sure there is </s>
<s> i mean i i have a friend or has a p. d. a. okay that he just it </s>
<s> pointed his toward any television he wants and figure out there </s>
<s> the specifications of it more control it </s>
<s> interesting also uh so i assume that that can be done with uh looking around the room </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> um alright so </s>
<s> i like um like an an idea this idea a touch screen remote with multi format features um right </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> i see </s>
<s> i think making at a nice material would be very important because so many of this remote stacy is universal remotes look so cheap and low quality and nice and slick </s>
<s> it would be important </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> i don't know like </s>
<s> this is your problem with using them </s>
<s> adding this whole like p. d. a. pen business is only one more thing to lose are gonna be careful what like </s>
<s> just something like keep in mind we start actually deal with this stuff </s>
<s> it would be really cool </s>
<s> i see </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> i like the idea of the l. multiply </s>
<s> uh yeah it will hold us please please please </s>
<s> namely the faceplates and it's uh ellen will have to combine </s>
<s> yeah which 'cause haven't really was you want as well </s>
<s> we never called user illusion </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> i think it would be such a bad idea to have a car locator device </s>
<s> it is simple but then you have an intelligent happy finder measure </s>
<s> um metaphor bundling it </s>
<s> unless you sign their telly with the remote right </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> well if we bundle orders of phone and he can always call it </s>
<s> true </s>
<s> you're not doing that then we can have something that just kinda rains from either </s>
<s> well there used to be those whistling devices but that's aluminum like </s>
<s> cool could we not do something more like just a little look like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote but you could play somewhere else that you press and it makes a remote page </s>
<s> kinda like i wonder what as um </s>
<s> uh cordless regular phones or yeah but page button does break we do something like that it's cool i think so </s>
<s> i think we could design yeah </s>
<s> yeah it </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> yeah i think this material qualities well like i guess what we can think about what kind of um </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> you know that apple's be really successful with the surgical why kind of business obviously kinda no titanium and you still bristol equals less couple years yeah very much so curves </s>
<s> do we would you have the minimum i'm i'm out i mean we're talking finances that are not selling out a forty pound remote whatever our forty dollar remote twenty five euro remote would be pretty </s>
<s> you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price </s>
<s> without without </s>
<s> getting that whole like you know good on the bargain store remote you know bargain serena remote that's black and you know massive some kind of analog balance there and some are definitely but um </s>
<s> have a think about what we can do you have to think about what we what to do or how we're gonna sell it and regular users are mind like these </s>
<s> grammars are are gonna be into this whole new let's design remote they use the buttons so after careful of exactly what working is to um who we're gonna be able to get out of </s>
<s> 's true </s>
<s> we're talking twenty five pounds or twenty five euros twenty five euros </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> 's like </s>
<s> it's </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> they're all we couldn't the roster are from the dollar </s>
<s> um without computer parts </s>
<s> oh if you can upgrade your computer by in the states like um you guys have fries </s>
<s> each computer uh electronic store </s>
<s> they serve um </s>
<s> obviously that's </s>
<s> they will sell things overseas </s>
<s> so you can buy stuff in america never shipped over for twenty three pounds of that </s>
<s> right so um </s>
<s> let's go ahead and wrapped that up here for now </s>
<s> i'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've gone </s>
<s> he's in the um </s>
<s> project documents so if you guys might need a reminder about the white </s>
<s> we've talked about on the different you know kind of trade offs that we've got and other ideas you can get software you'll be you sure </s>
<s> and uh right so thanks for that that's just to head back to work on what we were talking about for uh </s>
<s> going in again getting into </s>
<s> yeah half an hour </s>
<s> um yes 'kay or </s>
<s> i just got called </s>
<s> thank you right </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i'll side </s>
<s> a set of okay </s>
<s> cool all right so um </s>
<s> basically i'm just gonna uh go over real quickly um some news i just got from the board of how we're supposed to do with this um remote control and and or turnover you guys to make representations um what you felt </s>
<s> and then will have uh the discussion </s>
<s> so basically i well i just turn off the board and if he gets got this email as well but it needs to be television only </s>
<s> so now that we're doing t_v we're not doing anything else is just gonna be television remote </s>
<s> um it also needs to have the company colors included in it </s>
<s> um so that's red and black and has have a slogan </s>
<s> 'cause guess we get the slogan it's we put fashion in electronics </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and no teletext i'm not sure teletext is but um assuming you guys do so we don't wanna include that </s>
<s> um in this particular design </s>
<s> for reasons that i </s>
<s> i don't really know </s>
<s> this but it's the board so there you go </s>
<s> so basically um </s>
<s> given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later i mean 'cause television only we will be able to um change our uh </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> well we can sacrifice more function for a better television remote anyway so up to over to the industrial designer i'd go ahead and make a presentation </s>
<s> so 'kay </s>
<s> so do i well trained in </s>
<s> display here </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> may be a function i think the statistical model </s>
<s> cool okay </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> as page one </s>
<s> my presentation abilities </s>
<s> first powerpoint last night </s>
<s> so the uh method we're gonna have to understand how remote controls work mindset </s>
<s> successfully complete this project </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> remote control works as follows </s>
<s> it's all pretty basic stuff elan's </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> sends messages to another system </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> there's an energy source of of not like a battery or solar power </s>
<s> something along those lines </s>
<s> is an integrated circuit just the microchip </s>
<s> uh not actually compose messages </s>
<s> and usually the way a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system </s>
<s> uh user interface controls the chip </s>
<s> basically that's the casing and the buttons </s>
<s> and um recording the messages as well </s>
<s> so my findings um still uh preliminary study here and uh i found that too much metal remote design can potentially cause interference </s>
<s> the ability of the remote to send commands </s>
<s> in too much smoking 'cause remotes behave unexpectedly very simple signals </s>
<s> um or too much miller's you sometimes people pick up radio signals and like </s>
<s> and there's also the possibility the remote catching on fire injuring the customer </s>
<s> i just think of those lost it would be really bad </s>
<s> therefore i suggest primarily plastic construction </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> components just some ideas that i had um </s>
<s> energy source </s>
<s> it's kind of had to be eco-friendly so i thought maybe we could do something with solar power </s>
<s> with an outline battery backup </s>
<s> um user interface says this you can use metal i was thinking maybe high grade recycle plastic and </s>
<s> the chip </s>
<s> um so it can be a ship better wasting a way around that we can really be different in that respect </s>
<s> um the sender well on thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard multi channel </s>
<s> so we're going to happen to </s>
<s> ain't </s>
<s> yeah uh power on n. t. s. c. compatible and that </s>
<s> probably it's wonderful range </s>
<s> uh and the receiver of course the number of electronic devices </s>
<s> uh but in this case i mean t_vs </s>
<s> um personal preferences </s>
<s> i really think that wishes plastic is personal </s>
<s> come you simply can't </s>
<s> for it </s>
<s> those kinds of assets which have </s>
<s> and lily is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value you were thinking </s>
<s> is it is there a way that we can use 'em </s>
<s> modern </s>
<s> types of commas or modeler types of pass except maybe do you have some kind of aesthetic value </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> like in the white like the talk about like </s>
<s> or on the left of these laptops on the lower user are pretty nice </s>
<s> you can do is is another nice color better quality place that we can work with </s>
<s> yeah there should be a problem </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> for example that place capital something is something that's </s>
<s> perfectly possible for us to do </s>
<s> i will save my presentation thank you very much </s>
<s> um if next we can have the um user interface developer go ahead and </s>
<s> they kind of representation that integrates well </s>
<s> i'll um </s>
<s> spot yourself and yeah well </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> function f. eight looking </s>
<s> hold on </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> so i don't </s>
<s> supplied them all </s>
<s> yeah i guess </s>
<s> so just seeing it go sweep </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> well 've so </s>
<s> yeah we have a uh my technical functions design presentation </s>
<s> uh huh so </s>
<s> if user requirements we need here uh win </s>
<s> s. clean it up an electronic device it needs to be universal </s>
<s> um and possibly uh operator several different types of races although we know offline yeah sorry i didn't get tickets 's that's no problem </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> so my findings um basically want to send messages uh to a television set </s>
<s> um that would be any number of different things uh </s>
<s> such a switch on the television uh switch the next channel that sort of thing i think we're all quite uh </s>
<s> quite intelligent no no what uh normal remote control does </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> some of the other things i found is a complicated remote control so that we can't quite see why read there very well that uh </s>
<s> this </s>
<s> my remote control has many functions </s>
<s> um so can do a lot of things but it uh is quite complicated and most users will find it uh </s>
<s> find that they won't use most of the functions because i don't know how to use 'em and don't want to take the time </s>
<s> to learn how to do that </s>
<s> as you also nice is quite a boring design </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> another remote control </s>
<s> slightly different and it's a simple remote control </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> many less buttons but uh </s>
<s> how's </s>
<s> many fewer functions um much easier for the user to manipulate and use </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> well so that's a bit of a cheap luck and it's also quite point </s>
<s> so my personal preferences </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> revolutionized the idea of uh a remote control </s>
<s> um so retain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple format to display </s>
<s> uh fairly similar to work with </s>
<s> no he's gonna add another uh slide here but i think that </s>
<s> um okay just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple figures but it's </s>
<s> what </s>
<s> great experiment </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> i mean i don't get that you think so </s>
<s> hey i can play until that would be perfect think yeah </s>
<s> side </s>
<s> or not give it a little bit </s>
<s> yeah yeah </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> so this is me um </s>
<s> basically i was looking through some marketing reports we got um we had a usability test where </s>
<s> we were actually sort of like watching a hundred people </s>
<s> use t_v remote and see what it is that they're using and then they fill out question about what they like and what they do what about their general </s>
<s> t_v remote control practices </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> pretty much through testing we are finding out that most of the time </s>
<s> everybody's using changing the channel turning on using the volume </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> the majority the time that all is going on the other functions happen for some people they're important but the primary users are really really basic </s>
<s> um and so big complicated remotes like one was on the last </s>
<s> presentation are really </s>
<s> not the general public's use they are not using a lot of it they don't need it </s>
<s> they find it frustrating when there are all those buttons they don't know what to do with </s>
<s> and um we also found out that a fifty percent more people there the worst thing about remote is how often they lose it and i can't find in the room </s>
<s> so i think what we're talking about with a page or something will really come into play </s>
<s> with a lot of these people </s>
<s> um there's also uh survey about what they liked about remotes and pretty much they all think they're hideous </s>
<s> and not very useful and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options </s>
<s> i don't know if that's already to look into technically that that's designed people but it is something we're thinking about especially since the other demographics obviously when it's gonna keep going </s>
<s> sell if that's the direction we're hand in in something to think about </s>
<s> um but basically it really is the primary functions and get it to look nice which are </s>
<s> this standard's </s>
<s> so i i'll </s>
<s> it's a good start for us </s>
<s> s. great thank you sir </s>
<s> right and so um yeah i just uh </s>
<s> switch that you think here </s>
<s> finish a participant discussion help </s>
<s> plan on to the next phase </s>
<s> right so i think we've covered most of these important questions through this um </s>
<s> do you guys do presentations um </s>
<s> please guide uh the the industrial designer is suggests there were pretty much uh in fact we suggested that we need to go with plastic </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> it's error </s>
<s> she's recommended that we go for simple or functions so fewer functions um that we need to decide who we sell in this to use the years that suggested that </s>
<s> seventy five percent of people under thirty five one and thought about voice control </s>
<s> um so do we wanna go for that </s>
<s> or do we want to go for the older demographic and my thought is </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> we've guide </s>
<s> we've we're gonna go for a sleek look i mean we are putting the fashion in electronics and </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> in the media internet </s>
<s> pensioners of the world the s. cell so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic um </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> uh we need 'em wonder how about how we can make it </s>
<s> better and smaller and faster um </s>
<s> it would constrain the plastic very well we've got this idea uh rather saying we need to think about uh revolutionize in the way it's looking um which might be easier give that we're going for simple function and the ones on for tally </s>
<s> um so um </s>
<s> it's </s>
<s> how would this voice operation thing is i think a good idea um </s>
<s> assuming that it's do what what </s>
<s> um at least for the basic controls maybe we can balance it that way you know we can see </s>
<s> okay you can't say record alias tonight he said oh no we might be able to say um </s>
<s> volume up </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> i think it be possible to uh uh </s>
<s> combine the </s>
<s> locator device and the voice recognition technology </s>
<s> don't um </s>
<s> a 'cause work </s>
<s> and like yeah </s>
<s> with the simple command mike </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> yeah yeah something very basic </s>
<s> construct to be </s>
<s> wouldn't </s>
<s> when he found his elegantly within a two hundred foot range then </s>
<s> oh yeah i think it's plenty </s>
<s> the difficult see what would be in um i think </s>
<s> i like it </s>
<s> you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find </s>
<s> can you have something that picks up </s>
<s> um a voice from far away skid point it's hidden under the couch </s>
<s> but then again you have this week this week thing you know just a little chip or whatever that has a page but maybe that could be voice activated too </s>
<s> a little sticky pad to stick on top of your television do you say something to do that yeah yeah yeah </s>
<s> fein's you're </s>
<s> or an isolated magnet or something like that you know some of that would interfere i dunno the technical thing but yeah i like that i like that the voice recognition for the paging system </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> the thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity </s>
<s> of the remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into voice control so it could be sold to both the younger market all the market and the younger market could use kind of the poor voice control method </s>
<s> you know the recon unit just an option exactly you might consider the older market could use the simple design with the traditional buttons and one </s>
<s> i was thinking something about the screen sony </s>
<s> i'll go ahead </s>
<s> the uh </s>
<s> if we knew this touchpad screen thing and we still do we know that's an option technically </s>
<s> yes definitely an option to any of look into our hearts of uh touch-screen athletes and whatnot this year to be uh </s>
<s> you know almost as cheap as the button method at this point </s>
<s> 'cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be easier no for five basic functions you have um menu options i would have all these other complicated </s>
<s> voice recognition settings things that you not use every day and it a lot of people are can use but it is an option there for this high-tech </s>
<s> market that sort of b. is the sleek thing we're going for </s>
<s> gotta wonder therefore adding so much technology to this one remote or so gonna be able to meet her twelve hundred twelve fifty euro </s>
<s> worth looking goal for selling these things and h_m_m it seems like </s>
<s> no kabila handle all those functions with just one microchip </s>
<s> my question is quite the most expensive part of </s>
<s> true </s>
<s> the whole mechanism </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> so just something to consider </s>
<s> absolutely </s>
<s> okay um well i </s>
<s> yeah that's will cross that bridge um </s>
<s> until he decided later stages of development um but yeah that's </s>
<s> perfectly viable question </s>
<s> 'kay um so </s>
<s> i'm saying they were gonna just basically focus on this young demographic in a minute there um but then in the sense that it's bells and whistles </s>
<s> are available for anybody who wants 'em the basic rule maker sleek simple </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> function um </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> remote control </s>
<s> um i think this voice recognition thing is a bit we've got a market for it um i don't </s>
<s> many will be more likely cornering the market on him as well we don't have many </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> it was the microphone it </s>
<s> cool </s>
<s> right now we don't have many people uh these not very many competitors out there they do that so called </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> because you can't we touched on most of this the idea of a paging function a touch-screen faceplates </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> the thing with icsi would not be uh uh we have maybe sacrifice the faceplates for touch-screen </s>
<s> um i'm not sure that's necessarily correct i think you you kind of take the example of the mobile phone but </s>
<s> kind of has a portion of the device is not interchangeable or is the surrounding versions are interchangeable to the case if you have the casing be visible </s>
<s> his okay </s>
<s> back to yeah the cost of material </s>
<s> we have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of faceplates </s>
<s> with the package </s>
<s> that's something out for sale including </s>
<s> three four faceplates contract the cost of blue and yellow questions if we don't put them out really in a position to evaluate </s>
<s> that market we have the new tests on </s>
<s> faceplates whether already </s>
<s> so you gotta if there's even interest out there </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> right top my head sounds kind of like </s>
<s> again like i went </s>
<s> really go anywhere </s>
<s> yeah 'cause i haven't you will have to haul itself like a cell phones like we have uh you know no cure model acts and then ten people make faceplates for a week </s>
<s> yeah it just ah model for a of remote control </s>
<s> when listing of a spider phone is padded added around it is to have an automatic breast </s>
<s> you just sit home so somebody comes over to watch t_v </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> well hopefully some people have people coming out we'll true yeah most people have the intelligence of living here </s>
<s> uh i hope we can we can discuss that one in further when we think about um whether </s>
<s> the only </s>
<s> do costs and so forth um </s>
<s> true plastic is good cheap enough for making the whole thing out plastic anyway um </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah concept which later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important </s>
<s> um i think we've had a better discussion already only since the other questions comments it came up in his presentations </s>
<s> well we confirm that we're gonna go ahead with a a touch screen </s>
<s> yeah you're okay </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> yeah i think they'll be best let's </s>
<s> based on which one would you guys have all said to me let's go for it </s>
<s> a plastic </s>
<s> build separable plastic cased 'cause that that that is easy on the cast try to look for some kind of high quality or second pass against you recommended this great idea with a touch screen for the basic </s>
<s> function's </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> um oh yeah but the the provisional let's go for a touch-screen one with several sub menus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put that channel on the on and off switch on the touch screen </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> do we have </s>
<s> um maybe that occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are gonna have to recharge the remote controls </s>
<s> yet at the same time </s>
<s> that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost </s>
<s> 'cause it would have a docking bays </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> then again that 'cause as well </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> so those new within the last twenty years of you and with a touch screen </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> okay we went to influence implement this </s>
<s> yeah and must be buying if we tell them to well i i don't think yeah i guess anybody buying a lab uh remote control that we have to plug in so we have to see some kind of new battery technology okay so let's go with a um </s>
<s> touch-screen </s>
<s> with uh you know some kind of you with a with some kind age battery technology </s>
<s> for twelve euros </s>
<s> yeah well it it's it's worth looking into if no we can always a faulty just doing uh well presented plastic simple does it you know it's we i mean you can put that we could uh i don't know i mean suppose we could put the the basics on the center easiest you know you know people know the channel and volume function from large easy to get out and then the other the other bits and bob generic of romania </s>
<s> um who do it via states okay so will participate in the battery </s>
<s> focus uh </s>
<s> uh presentation </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> it's uh with this voice recognition option as well </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> just just for the simple functions the um </s>
<s> the on-off </s>
<s> channel's </s>
<s> volume right </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and um </s>
<s> a small picking function even if you get the voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that just uh i guess another infrared signal to the remote control um well should emit some kind of paging just to be a </s>
<s> um right so any comments </s>
<s> out's before we break and do </s>
<s> go to the next round of individual work on this </s>
<s> since we're doing uh touch screen you wanna look into the possibility of people being else uh </s>
<s> input different types of schemes for the 'kay yeah the actual interface part of it </s>
<s> things like that was just gonna be </s>
<s> one touch screen for like </s>
<s> interesting yeah </s>
<s> what what would be on a touch-screen 'cause he said earlier that we have to </s>
<s> think about company colors and um </s>
<s> a lotta something about it i can't but unless it </s>
<s> we put fashion you know like try yeah </s>
<s> we'll </s>
<s> it's my understanding that if you went into his skin you need to have some way for people to </s>
<s> della important is in the remote controls and cord then yeah </s>
<s> i think perhaps it's too much good idea but yeah i think that that one might might just be um </s>
<s> and just yeah i think that we might just be out of the range for this particular </s>
<s> a p. d. a. would that makes a lot of sense for p. d. n. a. </s>
<s> 'cause you're gonna be using it you </s>
<s> connected things anyway uh </s>
<s> and only guessing </s>
<s> i think we should focus a nice black you know a nice interface touch-screen </s>
<s> yeah yeah well i'm um in agreement with the wondering how we're gonna get uh </s>
<s> we put fashion into electronics the employee can use a touch-screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone and i'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like walter loading and then it goes away </s>
<s> perhaps it could be like a temporary </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> comes on every time you turn out of the mess it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved of saturated </s>
<s> yeah i'm looking for a syllable or not maybe half a millisecond there's a tradition sleep yeah </s>
<s> yeah yeah i d. it seems like it would suffice to just have the are on there </s>
<s> use the thing but but apparently not </s>
<s> okay so on their remote to do that but </s>
<s> see </s>
<s> flashing things and they just want it </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> ready to go </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> well fair enough um </s>
<s> and that would help the battery life to it if the remote would you have to press about it for the remote to turn on </s>
<s> then again who wants to turn on a remote control </s>
<s> well you have to do is touch screen uh oh wake up okay i'll go into that goes on to sleep mode </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i yeah i like that i like the idea of um </s>
<s> putting the logo in the bloodstream nice </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> um cool so y'all are things before break </s>
<s> alright fair enough </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> sounds good </s>
<s> and i saved a copy of this 'cause scusi reminders the save a copy of this and the myself do a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference </s>
<s> i put my files in the shared folder and related and </s>
<s> that's farrakhan's cool </s>
<s> okay phone </s>
<s> 's </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> things like that </s>
<s> um lucent's </s>
<s> cooperstown </s>
<s> it is very easy </s>
<s> i can't all right </s>
<s> i mean just </s>
<s> powerpoint 'cause uh </s>
<s> who </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> right so um </s>
<s> this meeting will be about the conceptual design don't have speech processing the conceptual design is it just something important that we </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> because it's kind of uh training the abstract into slightly more concrete and this meeting i believe will come to some </s>
<s> final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> right so um </s>
<s> apologies for the last meeting was brought to my attention that i did not make the rules clear enough um so i will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting </s>
<s> but um </s>
<s> there are enough things important times good </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> so basically we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time um it gonna go through </s>
<s> i love remotes go versus </s>
<s> time by me um e_m_l </s>
<s> call it what we know about um </s>
<s> what we discussed in last meeting possible directions </s>
<s> and then will make some more decisions on um </s>
<s> basic up for 'em up or idea </s>
<s> how we want this remote control to look </s>
<s> and work's </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> perfect </s>
<s> so without further ado </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> we're also first is treated </s>
<s> i'll go first and i didn't </s>
<s> figure where </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> it is neither am i calling the wrong handle then it is very good side and then i </s>
<s> participant two </s>
<s> uh okay i </s>
<s> mister curtis been to that it's place </s>
<s> yeah okay yeah </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> basically we would have talked about today is um component design </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> spend price-wise tension that we made is somewhat limited as we could do it because of what our manufacturer offers so we </s>
<s> basically what i'm gonna be doing </s>
<s> about that </s>
<s> um components of remote control okay recording kind about this program to get into it </s>
<s> more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions sometime soon </s>
<s> energy source um a manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources </s>
<s> your standard battery </s>
<s> solar cells </s>
<s> i manufactured in say anything about with the end so we might have to like if we go that route we might have to look elsewhere </s>
<s> um and also there's a kinetic energy possibility </s>
<s> basically it's like a um </s>
<s> idiap moving the remote which create of energy to keep it </s>
<s> running so that's one possibly i don't know whether that would be </s>
<s> powerful enough to eliminate a </s>
<s> touche </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> um so we have to look into that </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> the case we have a few options </s>
<s> plastic </s>
<s> rubber or what </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> and then as far as the weights shaped we can do </s>
<s> standard one p_l_p which would pop it up </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> curved or very sexy double curved </s>
<s> what kind of fitness are we looking at </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> i imagine that we could specify um </s>
<s> i don't see a reason to go outside of that convention yeah </s>
<s> three or four millimeters </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> the buttons </s>
<s> there are multiple scroll buttons available for manufacture applied </s>
<s> to use those you would have to use more chips </s>
<s> and that would cost </s>
<s> and if we do go with rubber double curved case </s>
<s> um what to use rubber push-buttons </s>
<s> 'cause the other buttons aren't compatible </s>
<s> um but uh </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and just so no they're touch screen equals </s>
<s> new chips which equals </s>
<s> many here </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> day's </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> one thing that i notice is that </s>
<s> most remotes operate on the infrared on the infrared part spectrum so you notice when you push a button about it can see it </s>
<s> anything coming out of that benefactor is like coming out of the remote and </s>
<s> and the television can backpack and if you what's record if you make a beer according to actually see a light </s>
<s> uh one thing that i thought might be interesting ways to use </s>
<s> part user visible light current remote just kind of as a fun gimmick </s>
<s> as you can actually see something coming out remotely push it caused a happier part of the spectrum that way </s>
<s> damage to him and all that </s>
<s> can't </s>
<s> it is an option that we could have that offer on suppress 'cause worked like </s>
<s> she'll yeah </s>
<s> i am sure that we could do that </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> the other is good idea yeah just as a fun </s>
<s> kinetic uh </s>
<s> just says part of it </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> they don't the circuit board that we're gonna use all since the chip </s>
<s> uh we don't have any way around d. t. a one one eight three five </s>
<s> um findings okay we are very limited by where current manufacturers can offer </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> in my question of you is </s>
<s> should we look to other manufacturers must make do with what we have available </s>
<s> interest requires the challenge machine </s>
<s> like say shop around that without time constraints is that really feasible option yeah </s>
<s> right that's my concern too </s>
<s> um if we do go to the lithium battery route then we have to go outside </s>
<s> ah </s>
<s> my personal preferences are still like cards on the table </s>
<s> uh i think </s>
<s> we should like uh the solar battery group </s>
<s> just kind of keep with the environment silly </s>
<s> friendly thing that we have going on </s>
<s> uh i like the idea that visible light signalling or something test sets apart </s>
<s> and uh i was thinking about </s>
<s> i was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to see different </s>
<s> taste </s>
<s> so now </s>
<s> so confined by one </s>
<s> style and say some you know say ah </s>
<s> the one if we just go if one is to go over well then </s>
<s> where in the best situation you need </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> can you marking piloting two </s>
<s> try to see what kind of for lunch clearly </s>
<s> so now the received </s>
<s> it's an option actually there's i've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now </s>
<s> which actually might even come into play </s>
<s> before hand </s>
<s> okay to decide for now </s>
<s> making very much and it's perfect so i guess i make sense reading </s>
<s> yeah i guess so </s>
<s> 'cause i found some interesting things </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> the passengers you know yeah what it to you in it </s>
<s> uh huh right </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> 'kay market travels </s>
<s> screen </s>
<s> um but the bayes has looking at what's going on the remote control market right now </s>
<s> and what's going on in other design field to see sort of what's what's trendy what's new what's happening </s>
<s> um remote control right now basically everybody says they want new were fancier more exciting or second isn't boring </s>
<s> normal functional um that we need innovative design options and it needs to be easy user interface </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> the challenge is that current trends right now across the board in fashioning furniture in technology is it a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing i am not saying we should have you know timit shaped remote controls or anything but </s>
<s> i think it is possible maybe to use um natural colors like if it is an option that whole organic sleek clean it </s>
<s> mine thing and maybe some we can look into different skin options of or if we can afford this touch plate thing ever touch </s>
<s> face screen </s>
<s> interface um maybe having it uh images of be specific like you could choose your menu bullets to be </s>
<s> it's a different sheet </s>
<s> they are sort of not being saved by the children but you know what i mean to sort of </s>
<s> and apparently the feel of the next couple years is spongy i've not something i like element definitely is found out if we can get around to getting piling i thought maybe i'd casing option like at </s>
<s> not like a scheme but like at holder almost if you could do like um other options or what options or something should have mentioned this um </s>
<s> as far as the rubber that we can use um we can use a rubber </s>
<s> as part of the case or has a consistency of those stress balls he </s>
<s> might be nice to to go somewhere </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> yeah so something to sit down for now so overall i think we should stick with what we're finding every is looking for easy use technologically innovative and this fancy new </s>
<s> i think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe the rubber option is our best way to go for right now </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> interface oh the interface graphics for yeah </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> well i think but then if the touch screen thing is gonna work out for us that really non issue </s>
<s> i like it to have rubber itchy because it's </s>
<s> ten set </s>
<s> my sister being durable or something that you can drop it doesn't matter 'cause so many you go to somebody houses you station super </s>
<s> oh controls very true </s>
<s> yeah it with that yeah very much that would have the phones you didn't we could have in duct tape </s>
<s> casing </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> okay it i think that goes against the whole thing and see something new on line and then </s>
<s> i shall go into the kernel like uh </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> yeah we've we've </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> yeah that's what i know </s>
<s> great picture that uh </s>
<s> yeah well </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> computers are just </s>
<s> one moment please </s>
<s> so into a interface concept </s>
<s> but it fits for user interface design so you never user pays guys's basically aspects of a computer system </s>
<s> that </s>
<s> we can see </s>
<s> were you </s>
<s> or otherwise uh </s>
<s> perceive </s>
<s> uh commands or mechanisms that basically user uses to control the operating operating system </s>
<s> here's an in a series of the remote controls that are out on the market today </s>
<s> i think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a like </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh </s>
<s> concept </s>
<s> uh voice recognition we have we um actually have some new </s>
<s> uh information from where </s>
<s> research design team but uh get to that in a moment </s>
<s> um so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples </s>
<s> um and basically record your own verbal labels can connect into the remote control </s>
<s> now our design team research team has been l. two </s>
<s> uh set up a system in which </s>
<s> uh you can teach their remote control whisk recognition system </s>
<s> to respond she um </s>
<s> with standard responses like </s>
<s> you could say good morning </s>
<s> uh remote control and i will say sexy female voice good morning joe </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> and in fact we already have this for a coffee maker line </s>
<s> well single people only have another group on the remote control decision node </s>
<s> huh um i've </s>
<s> another concept is what uh apple has come up with the spinning wheel with uh l. c. display like on the uh ipods which i'm sure most of you know um </s>
<s> um didn't </s>
<s> then we have the scroll button with the particular push-button yeah like a modern mouse a bit bulky a bit crazy </s>
<s> i don't think that's what we're necessarily going for </s>
<s> and uh some special components uh </s>
<s> ideas like uh blocking having the ability to block channels from you for your children </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and uh dedicated buttons for </s>
<s> for commonly used uh channels </s>
<s> and even uh ideas like secure hidden programming but uh again if we go a flat screen i don't think that's a big issue </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and uh this is kind of the uh </s>
<s> the big idea about uh uh uh at </s>
<s> uh the jumble universal remote control is almost impossible the misplaced easier yeah see that </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> again probably not what we're going for so i mean my ideas here and kind of where i think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular ipod </s>
<s> uh with a hard plastic uh plastic casing although i think some of the suggestions we come up with are definitely uh very good ideas </s>
<s> uh changeable casings and uh </s>
<s> our design team was possibly talking about including one extra faceplate with the package kind of </s>
<s> set the idea that you can change it and you can try to change any kind of get used to it </s>
<s> thinking about maybe buying another one which and </s>
<s> add value to our uh </s>
<s> bottom line </s>
<s> uh touch-screen brave </s>
<s> um possibly having go to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen </s>
<s> uh the important ones like power volume and jump between channels </s>
<s> um and of course her voice commands or someone to talk to a little bit about already </s>
<s> and uh the user recognizable colors interested recognition of the features uh </s>
<s> that are around so </s>
<s> read for power </s>
<s> um um areas for </s>
<s> different </s>
<s> volume up some down some channels have some doubts about that </s>
<s> and uh perhaps even adding in some </s>
<s> stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like </s>
<s> for </s>
<s> for instance my toast maker that i got from the bank </s>
<s> has jokes when it's ready </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> no he's </s>
<s> great and uh </s>
<s> that is about it </s>
<s> i mean run </s>
<s> cool </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> well i have good ideas </s>
<s> good facts they have </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> add to the needs a couple don logistics of this for this you have to stand up again </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> 'kay </s>
<s> right so </s>
<s> it and all that stuff i discuss um </s>
<s> no kind of to come to some decisions um </s>
<s> i think we can just get a line after this which had uh </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> based on what </s>
<s> and even presented as far as the um </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> there is </s>
<s> costs and benefits </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> i think i don't know what you guys think about the touch screen at this point </s>
<s> i think is the most marketable feature just because it's so new added something that is showing up in other places </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> uh can only </s>
<s> really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be that would be a really main </s>
<s> cost's </s>
<s> source then right </s>
<s> my guess and that is that there is to incorporate touch-screen technologies gonna causes upwards of </s>
<s> seventeen fifty </s>
<s> you're oh </s>
<s> to present them and yeah that's just nastiness </s>
<s> well you guys are always the damper on this um okay you industrial designer yeah </s>
<s> it's um and our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty </s>
<s> uh i mean i thought there was some flexibility with that </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> there is it's just it is nationally justify and how much you know it does i mean we're gonna increase the price to make money </s>
<s> um from twelve fifty if we wanna get a fifty a hundred percent profit margin </s>
<s> um that would mean selling it for twenty five symbols by seventeen fifty five to that's thirty five </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> where you guys come up with these numbers </s>
<s> which stuff top my head </s>
<s> it is pending further emails </s>
<s> yeah but from the moment break um </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> do i think that's what people would pay for and if you gonna pay for an expensive high class remote you can expect to do something </s>
<s> that's true isn't it would be in a class of john </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> and that's to be fairly um </s>
<s> that percent of the market we're not going for mass in a in a mass sales anyway we're going to make </s>
<s> i mean what what i'm talking about selling easily and of these things we just could not for twenty five euros so </s>
<s> we could probably maybe shrink the profit margin rather than sell it for twenty five sell for thirty but that's something we can find it still with new um </s>
<s> i say that we </s>
<s> provision that go with the transcriber </s>
<s> where were you what would you have done better on </s>
<s> i'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and i also think that we can probably come up with some sort of energy per uh </s>
<s> means like to go about this kind of production like corners might even the on the third floor suggested to them </s>
<s> well we can look at this other manufacturing option you wouldn't get 'em somewhere else cheaper um </s>
<s> 's true </s>
<s> but we couldn't </s>
<s> initially go with what we have </s>
<s> and if we can find a starting point anyway so </s>
<s> and we can have this very simple touch screen you know there's always the opportunity it's gonna be about the size of the ipod or whatever </s>
<s> yeah well yeah i guess we can play around the feel of it i let's say that okay so the touch-screen will be our </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> our main selling point here </s>
<s> i think that we really have two main selling point as a close race engine and the voice recognition really is pretty </s>
<s> bells and whistles kinda lower yeah the voice rec thing i mean </s>
<s> if if we're looking and </s>
<s> bottom-line </s>
<s> now we're looking up in the costs are seventeen to get touch-screen i think we might have to drop </s>
<s> voice right i think we have to decide between oh definitely yeah to be asked we have the cable we have the design in house i mean we've we've come up with this </s>
<s> what is new works we're using it for a coffee machines already </s>
<s> i can pass the online email from my uh guy and uh </s>
<s> 'kay down the hall </s>
<s> sounds good </s>
<s> for real </s>
<s> what do you think ah anything about the voice rec </s>
<s> i think if we </s>
<s> we do both the obviously crash and cross trying to get away help </s>
<s> plate's </s>
<s> despite interior </s>
<s> become the rolls royce of remote controls but square </s>
<s> pretty much </s>
<s> very nice </s>
<s> i mean we we have period reflect back on what our market research survey and they said they wanted voice recognition </s>
<s> course maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option but </s>
<s> definitely know what the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have a technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know will sell </s>
<s> is the call i don't think i can give that up so like really i can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> does having both really upper class </s>
<s> i can see how wouldn't i mean </s>
<s> is yellow after is um you can have a fast you can have it cheap you can have it </s>
<s> quality </s>
<s> pick two or three </s>
<s> you know you can't you can't have often yeah </s>
<s> 'cause you use having number of chips so you need to deal with each </s>
<s> the function function </s>
<s> well if we're gonna be able to that alright so we have to pick between one of the zero </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> otherwise yeah we just it just becomes cost prohibitive what which which do we suspect </s>
<s> we should a whole lot we should hold on to </s>
<s> well we already have research backing voice recognition </s>
<s> and it's you know </s>
<s> physically sell it </s>
<s> oh by that </s>
<s> uh i've i </s>
<s> i personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell i think that we need to go with the new we can table this touch screen </s>
<s> for our next model </s>
<s> i would have to side with that i think so </s>
<s> the voice recognition is simple we already have the </s>
<s> all the technology analysis ready to go it's package and it's </s>
<s> what is the cost of like one is cheaper due to the ah to do the uh touch screen </s>
<s> nothing </s>
<s> well my </s>
<s> it's um </s>
<s> he's just off the top of my head </s>
<s> keep my </s>
<s> but </s>
<s> i think </s>
<s> the voice recognition would </s>
<s> that was it </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> they're both going to </s>
<s> push the cost up </s>
<s> but um </s>
<s> 'cause we already have the technology and has for the voice recognition </s>
<s> right gonna have to do this much </s>
<s> design work in some fancy design work as well pushed herself </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> can any </s>
<s> yep we have to your uh class and we're still that that we have to do with this battery issue nearly as much either we can stick with what we've already got </s>
<s> and a lot of the ways to </s>
<s> 'kay so i'm getting </s>
<s> right so more or less you guys think that that other tilde voice recognition will be better </s>
<s> i think it's a lower risk option would be a right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in our best option </s>
<s> okay sorry </s>
<s> you will need the touch-screen in favor of voice recognition </s>
<s> it's union settle </s>
<s> so and when are we gonna have basic </s>
<s> prototypes coming up next that's you guys next step right yeah well we're so cool sort out what it worked in </s>
<s> what else we're gonna talk about one hundred temper yeah that's our next step to develop what are we going to talk now about um the materials arrangements can you would just run through it yeah okay yeah um </s>
<s> you discuss either a lithium or a solar power with the solar power be enough to </s>
<s> fuel a voice recognition of this killer static one would that be enough to feel a voice recognition remote animal </s>
<s> the solar power definitely would be by </s>
<s> i think </s>
<s> just keep people from getting annoyed 'cause sometimes all of our fellows just know around that we should </s>
<s> install a small backup battery </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> just to come in those moments when </s>
<s> for whatever reason the remote hasn't looks administrative in your basement </s>
<s> my wife </s>
<s> yeah when we can't guarantee something everywhere so having it should resources probably the worst of the same as the solar power </s>
<s> calculator and you know how there's does not really require that much why </s>
<s> cheryl </s>
<s> um obviously a little more light than a calculator but we're not talking about </s>
<s> a white light does have to be </s>
<s> out </s>
<s> taking some path yeah </s>
<s> for understanding </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> very thin crown </s>
<s> i'm willing to agree with everything that's been said </s>
<s> uh i have to say though that um </s>
<s> and other ideas come up and if we're really not uh handling the </s>
<s> remote control to a great extent </s>
<s> we could possibly get away from the idea of having a handheld remote control </s>
<s> and maybe kind of have </s>
<s> 'round </s>
<s> remote control that kind of looks like a paper weight or something like that </s>
<s> kind of a sweet little uh anything that sits on your table or something </s>
<s> interesting </s>
<s> not the thought why moving away from handheld y. </s>
<s> that's t. </s>
<s> well if you don't need to pick it up </s>
<s> it could kinda you discount voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job </s>
<s> do you think people are </s>
<s> people are buying are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition search or something </s>
<s> it is sometimes be true and it </s>
<s> problem i think we're being and selling it to more than just </s>
<s> voice recognition people like we want to work and fundamentally we have is limited as well right </s>
<s> but that's done that so bother i mean if you look at the catalogue from </s>
<s> places like the sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um </s>
<s> but is it apple makes these really </s>
<s> pretentious speakers with the sub woofers and like clear in class and you know when we got a little true middle type of um splinters i mean why not have a little rounded kind of thing it could still have the basic buttons on it </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well </s>
<s> with that but yeah </s>
<s> and maybe a menu button and so forth you know um uses channel button to scroll through the menu if they want to record programs or whatever you know because i think it on something yes </s>
<s> we need to escape the traditional or shape of </s>
<s> remote'll </s>
<s> maybe something that looks nice and the tables would be great even though and handled the same time </s>
<s> i think it's all about </s>
<s> following apple's we'd </s>
<s> on the i'm thinking of the airport morgan'll you know like that little </s>
<s> hot little tiny ones right </s>
<s> yeah i mean unless although we do um well as i recall english you mentioned we need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminum thing and get back to it but he can have a very tasteful um </s>
<s> more in color or a little kind of um </s>
<s> tariq on a bowl or something </s>
<s> still i mean yeah along those lines yeah i like that i like that ideal life um </s>
<s> let's see we can deal as far as that goes okay and the other material like the plastics and so forth we were discussing that being i use to make a rubber kind of </s>
<s> softer feel um um you know i work for further input to participate it's a bit </s>
<s> give us just to get </s>
<s> yeah you know something where </s>
<s> it's uh a more advanced approach of classically has some kind of uh </s>
<s> tactile response to it </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> just kind of the squishy feel </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> which is the next big thing so let's </s>
<s> one or anything okay </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> yeah it's if you can do it squishy nolan remote control looking remote control but to be very i mean just to be just put it literally put it on the </s>
<s> the night the coffee table next italian same by my own </s>
<s> one thing </s>
<s> no i can i can yeah that's good </s>
<s> uh we sort of discussed costs </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> i guess what that's gonna be uh i think if we were a bit over budget it might be okay </s>
<s> sorry about the uh lack of information costas haven't been provided finish by manufacturers </s>
<s> well i was handed down i said </s>
<s> no more than one more than i do </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> no just yeah 'cause from there </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> so if we visited the touch-screen in more or less will that out um i think so were more or less can we what we're more or less in agreement that we wanted to have a um </s>
<s> a simple kind of function </s>
<s> you know not </s>
<s> too complex right </s>
<s> well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis </s>
<s> although i'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions they should be secondary </s>
<s> at least if not functioning then visually like those shouldn't be </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> like many ending residents </s>
<s> if you if we're not going to touch screen route then we can um </s>
<s> just 's incorporate maybe </s>
<s> something unfolds out like well you often see all these kinds remotes is the most basic functions up here in something that slides down to </s>
<s> the on the more compaq </s>
<s> she's </s>
<s> yeah well do you wanna consider like an ipod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options </s>
<s> in </s>
<s> number in a cost issue natural we also have done them at the thing uh for for gonna have a normal remote looking remote </s>
<s> true how do we </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> fair enough </s>
<s> but no i mean we could use lighter compartment you know like if it's a it's a little vaguely ovoid type thing and easy to have a compartment in there or you know about but a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then assigns up and down type thing like on huh </s>
<s> but only the need later </s>
<s> yeah multimedia players will just have </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> a menu button on the side and then gets all sides around the meanings kind of </s>
<s> yeah and you to me like that </s>
<s> so we go are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons for point to use are going to use scroll buttons </s>
<s> rubber buttons </s>
<s> well it seems like </s>
<s> there it seems to me that we can just do the and </s>
<s> stick with the rubber </s>
<s> 'cause is for probably gonna be using some kind of </s>
<s> um you've </s>
<s> rubber for the outside case and others have stick with that right </s>
<s> thing to a certain extent we have to stick with uh </s>
<s> kind of had a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then </s>
<s> and then make a unique feature casing and want to and her voice command </s>
<s> well those basic just like for directions that are they can use as a menu or channel and volume are probably won't do it are really versatile and </s>
<s> every already got them to some extent remotes thirty own so it's not like we're dealing with every re learning things 'cause </s>
<s> it's not so many places to one ninety four </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> we very kind of covered this as well </s>
<s> seems to be selling um a number of more or less clear that would occur </s>
<s> target this youth market </s>
<s> ooh </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> especially now with </s>
<s> it's a thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population particularly in technological fields um </s>
<s> hm to decorate it okay </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> yeah alright well most covered what we need to cover thing for it in the in the final thoughts before we think about doing reported i'm not a prototype </s>
<s> well what are we actually doing </s>
<s> oh right i was just gonna step on to um </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> oh i wasn't in a way that i wasn't up about that </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> sorry </s>
<s> yeah what do you uh </s>
<s> the um yeah okay i was gonna assign tasks in the next scene but if any any other final thoughts before we go ahead and </s>
<s> cool </s>
<s> so have we said that we are gonna go ahead </s>
<s> different style cases for different people </s>
<s> always going to go with one </s>
<s> it's very is very important to predict because </s>
<s> you have different cases that might open remarkable that obviously </s>
<s> we have </s>
<s> just one case and it doesn't go over well </s>
<s> yeah it's a stretch obviously having marcus also cost wise </s>
<s> well then again colors will be so hard to do you can uh or something </s>
<s> i you know i have a kind of an actual what color like a stake in uh it </s>
<s> um i'll </s>
<s> all the green or something it telling me so much of a problem to incorporate into the color of the rubber i don't think </s>
<s> and again copying i max kind of for ipod </s>
<s> back apples under color scheme </s>
<s> yeah totally </s>
<s> yeah i think that's probably get okay so with worker </s>
<s> um multiple </s>
<s> 'kay is colors </s>
<s> but yeah stick with the same kind of </s>
<s> haven't </s>
<s> yeah the same basically non remote kind of remote design </s>
<s> cool </s>
<s> right so we have the next meeting about half an hour </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> would the uh uh like my father like you to work on just the basic look-and-feel what can we accomplish </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> given these parameters are you sort of sort out this kind of uh </s>
<s> no remote remote </s>
<s> but um </s>
<s> so what are broad constraints before we develop design a prototype </s>
<s> and um well if you get it </s>
<s> figure out how probably best to layout this idea of the simple design with the voice recognition delta and and also this </s>
<s> kind of drop down </s>
<s> or </s>
<s> so on the side kind of menu options are simple </s>
<s> so now working out how we can get dissolves in the same place </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and you can check product evaluation and some </s>
<s> pilots and stuff and they need you guys to work together and making a prototype </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> hm using </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> prototype building material </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and also um specific instructions will be sent email you coaches marks so that's at the start with your hands that right now has to include says goodbye wheels </s>
<s> alright </s>
<s> this is it detects text gasp </s>
<s> cool </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> question </s>
<s> eligible list </s>
<s> yeah so maybe just a little bit yes </s>
<s> hanson's though </s>
<s> really for this one </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> i'll set yeah </s>
<s> cool </s>
<s> alright it is powerpoint time </s>
<s> i think more powerpoints in this particular experiment </s>
<s> have ever done in my life before disappearing </s>
<s> this component </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> so uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um </s>
<s> look at the prototype </s>
<s> yeah and um </s>
<s> right so um </s>
<s> i finally figured out what this whole second bullet points about in my them a coach was thirty thirty minutes um supposed to read the minutes from the previous me oh really okay i think oh </s>
<s> i dunno </s>
<s> otherwise it just saying i mean the secretary and then </s>
<s> therefore taking the instance itself </s>
<s> just to go uh huh </s>
<s> just real briefly go over minutes from last meeting </s>
<s> uh i will open up down slower </s>
<s> you know </s>
<s> right right </s>
<s> wait for it </s>
<s> it's tsk </s>
<s> sh uh </s>
<s> yeah annette's </s>
<s> yeah you know </s>
<s> this uh like </s>
<s> he's </s>
<s> this is this is very </s>
<s> high powered stuff yeah </s>
<s> that look like a very got </s>
<s> so um basically the more the story from the last the uh last meeting was that </s>
<s> family </s>
<s> there we had meetings from uh we had presentations then by the industrial designer will for making the wrong end of sarah about what we can do here </s>
<s> um in what </s>
<s> sort of limitations are operating with </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> i just you know that users are operating under </s>
<s> what kind of risk would be looking at what some of the various approaches we were discussing </s>
<s> and we essentially came the conclusion that we should </s>
<s> develop a remote with their voice recognition i than a vaguely non remote light shape um because you didn't really use it as a remotes as you could just use your voice </s>
<s> uh would include 's um </s>
<s> mostly just a simple design features for television operation </s>
<s> but with a slider for about the for more advanced functions for users </s>
<s> um and uh the uh </s>
<s> uh the idea and the idea were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at </s>
<s> so i i'd </s>
<s> that's sort of back to the main </s>
<s> me here um </s>
<s> go ahead and take away guys </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> we have sampled ah </s>
<s> prototype um </s>
<s> what's we said about it </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> we take into account a lot of things that we went over in the last meeting um </s>
<s> so the most important things to consider that it's </s>
<s> we had decided not to go for the touch screen which can save you </s>
<s> and opted for some </s>
<s> very </s>
<s> barge </s>
<s> button's for the </s>
<s> primary </s>
<s> function's </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> this is going to be the on-off button and then we have </s>
<s> these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here </s>
<s> that we said those were the most important </s>
<s> uh button's </s>
<s> and then </s>
<s> for the more advanced 's </s>
<s> uh functions there's a slide uh </s>
<s> panel here </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> you can see that talents were things going on </s>
<s> but this actually can side back and </s>
<s> parts are very nice a static winds up either way </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> as far as the uh all this white thing we decided to go in uh what's what colors are there any one high level </s>
<s> of course that's annoying for some people that function </s>
<s> can be trained down perfect </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> no it's important to me we talked quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh </s>
<s> faces </s>
<s> and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural if you </s>
<s> for mainly 'cause </s>
<s> fruity </s>
<s> yeah reality </s>
<s> i know </s>
<s> um of course that's uh interchange wanted uh </s>
<s> i think it would be desirable for the uh </s>
<s> for the regular product in the in the in the </s>
<s> in the first packaging could be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done is yeah </s>
<s> um and it's you can see on the television there </s>
<s> now we have the uh voice detector device how uh </s>
<s> also something </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> uh me </s>
<s> so that that will work quite well with </s>
<s> with regard defined in this uh </s>
<s> contraption </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> what other things we see here well um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel </s>
<s> um and so i think that will work well for you it's or market is um </s>
<s> and uh </s>
<s> let's see well clearly there's gonna be some more colors and one not available </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> do you have anything else down to that </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> uh what about the materials it is </s>
<s> uh the entire thing is covered in the rubber coding </s>
<s> so it very </s>
<s> durable </s>
<s> uh stuck in it </s>
<s> break like sometimes a plastic construct </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> of course as you can see if you touch it does have the lights squishy </s>
<s> so actually important enough that the television </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> yeah if there's an earthquake or anything like that </s>
<s> 'kay it actually is a double instead </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i i i i don't but i never noticed but i wrote the yeah </s>
<s> your company's name </s>
<s> oh well uh </s>
<s> uh this uh this is actually </s>
<s> an apple inside </s>
<s> give me the story about um rock factory </s>
<s> um but </s>
<s> is encased in a new uh </s>
<s> type of </s>
<s> um okay is preserved and moaning </s>
<s> we've got to have or something you're not talking about making televisions egyptology and whistles and so if if the t_v chip </s>
<s> fair comparison off at least </s>
<s> a possible name on it </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> but i think that's uh i think that sums up the main features are of the remote i dunno if you guys have any questions or whether it's that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> nature um to come in under budget </s>
<s> i we'd to </s>
<s> yeah this 'cause well to put us into um production </s>
<s> looking about </s>
<s> was our uh coldest twelve </s>
<s> fifty euro </s>
<s> um and this guy actually can then uh eleven ninety nine </s>
<s> so i was quite pleased with the </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> one thing that we didn't uh </s>
<s> obviously we have a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons but we used one for classic </s>
<s> rubber button </s>
<s> and um </s>
<s> 's as we did that </s>
<s> we have to use as many microchips which is quite nice that's well keep the cost down below </s>
<s> so you know has a lot of </s>
<s> ma'am </s>
<s> technology </s>
<s> um for example the voice recognition by ways is just a simple </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i think </s>
<s> if we shopped around for other manufacturers </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> we might be able to </s>
<s> get even cheaper </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> do we talk about the words </s>
<s> recognition uh option </s>
<s> oh no we haven't are so um </s>
<s> so uh on the back you will notice this </s>
<s> yeah here which is actually the voice recognition </s>
<s> yeah okay </s>
<s> oakland's all </s>
<s> and uh </s>
<s> i think it's nicely designed into the into the opera left </s>
<s> um other but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest design sort of research you must be another couple to come up with basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker </s>
<s> um design that we were talking about are different </s>
<s> i think that uh he's given a proven </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> ease of use and what not </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> and uh </s>
<s> allows features </s>
<s> like </s>
<s> the remote actually talking back to the user yeah </s>
<s> cool question's </s>
<s> no similar thing that's do we have um other </s>
<s> five letter words gains covers </s>
<s> in plain our there's gonna be developed later once we see on the cup we have go or on </s>
<s> finishes denomination </s>
<s> well we didn't quite have enough which he'll uh </s>
<s> oh i was actually apart and i don't you guys handyman right </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> what </s>
<s> as you can see this is just the most superficial way </s>
<s> he'd um </s>
<s> be very easy to okay </s>
<s> put another way or just </s>
<s> or something else like that </s>
<s> okay actually this bottom red ring here are just some clips </s>
<s> and then you poems and then you've and hearing okay </s>
<s> and you </s>
<s> plate on top of that so i mean there are are we definitely yeah priced out uh spongy even spongy or </s>
<s> non actual work on materials which i think worked out fine we also continued on with the ideas of blah following </s>
<s> uh apples color schemes </s>
<s> with kind of the old later orange and signing in </s>
<s> it's not quite a a faceplate it's more like a studio faceplate </s>
<s> okay okay it's </s>
<s> it's simple enough that </s>
<s> and the factory 'kay </s>
<s> we could raise a quite different on it it </s>
<s> walks in place such there </s>
<s> yeah it's pretty big </s>
<s> permanent </s>
<s> the same time </s>
<s> if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments we could go in the face plate way if you know any yep </s>
<s> it still optional yeah you know very cool </s>
<s> just tap </s>
<s> right here these guys that's </s>
<s> very very good work like it </s>
<s> really </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> what we need to discuss now is the finance of it um i got me you've got </s>
<s> deep-fried it it and number that actually sounds quite nice um </s>
<s> the trouble is i just given this by framing it's parameter spreadsheet the parts are gonna just </s>
<s> tentatively put in what it's going to look like </s>
<s> um i'm just gonna clear this out real quickly </s>
<s> but look's like </s>
<s> so we just </s>
<s> if we can just add 'em eyes what's in here we've got this it's a solar cell thing right </s>
<s> right said with a bag of battery but it it's in there yeah with the back okay </s>
<s> um yeah it's recognition error actually doubles is uh </s>
<s> as the source filter clever clever well then </s>
<s> um so i guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um </s>
<s> it's a c. s. speaker in a sense at the same time isn't it </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> it's just making use the same space seem to gain space </s>
<s> um in that case it's more of a single curved case i guess would be that the the general yeah one baby curve is considered </s>
<s> um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> push-button interface </s>
<s> um with this other drop-down so maybe we get to push button interface is the way </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> yeah and uh 'em special </s>
<s> i guess is the we've got out server would material or rubbery type material </s>
<s> yeah discussion throughout yes i guess you have to mark special color special forms well </s>
<s> and she because it is very and convention yeah it's not very nice i like it yes </s>
<s> so it looks like a </s>
<s> okay me at sixteen bit over budget </s>
<s> um richard's </s>
<s> so what we could do perhaps </s>
<s> a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells </s>
<s> um or take out the back up battery </s>
<s> useful </s>
<s> i mean i think that uh if we're talking about it being one or main selling features being experimental with uh this one </s>
<s> although it does still have a battery so i'm not sure that </s>
<s> you know what the sellers on the i mean we could take </s>
<s> we take the battery out in the d. c. any probably work one nine eight percent time by </s>
<s> you have to separate </s>
<s> 'cause center for that one percent of time </s>
<s> people can't </s>
<s> see how black </s>
<s> my remote is working women in their opinion people are upset </s>
<s> single one run it's better to keep the battery </s>
<s> instruct scrap the whole solar battery right 'cause that's </s>
<s> seven table to </s>
<s> the thing that we had </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> what's difficult we have all these things integral to the um </s>
<s> to the design of it that we just can't back out and uh have to be </s>
<s> it seems like we have to go back to uh </s>
<s> square one </s>
<s> in a way </s>
<s> um if we're gonna try to </s>
<s> and do one bit we probably have to do most definitely </s>
<s> yeah um </s>
<s> although we don't want to get rid of the whole environmental </s>
<s> i mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way you work in this is like a natural new </s>
<s> thing </s>
<s> but honestly if we cut that one piece our actually coming and budget effect i mean that's quite right </s>
<s> yeah i mean you this way we on the idea that </s>
<s> we are the main selling point could be already this where's recognition thing i mean which is that it's sorry yeah that's what sending us into this young market now to we started from cell </s>
<s> i don't know and i mean you know perhaps when the sub technology comes down in price we can bring that back in the beginning but it looks like at this point that maybe out of our league </s>
<s> the reality is </s>
<s> you know </s>
<s> probably from an ideological standpoint i would like to stick with the uh </s>
<s> the solar cell but </s>
<s> i kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model yeah </s>
<s> and uh </s>
<s> you know i think either or </s>
<s> i think that i think that we need to come to compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project </s>
<s> with the the solar cell </s>
<s> yeah i think misfortune that same best option so i we were gonna </s>
<s> get below </s>
<s> uh callison no </s>
<s> twelve fifty </s>
<s> 'cause we can't remove the push-buttons curtis </s>
<s> they are typically he kind of um </s>
<s> yeah 'kay get rid of </s>
<s> yeah i mean </s>
<s> removing the </s>
<s> changing the case wouldn't be so much of the </s>
<s> so he'd um </s>
<s> um no we change in my case materials </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> so yeah what's like to be the only thing </s>
<s> yeah so that would be a it's a major change but </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> i saw agreement on that </s>
<s> i for sure i i think we are </s>
<s> i think that was a good compromise your preference </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> moving along swiftly um so i guess now we just go to </s>
<s> the project evaluation </s>
<s> which i will allow </s>
<s> conservative helping me </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> caught oh of course sorry no problem </s>
<s> u. h. p. will be great </s>
<s> think you'll </s>
<s> if they'd o'clock </s>
<s> okay i'm glad that you do that on purpose later </s>
<s> okay i'll basically i was just evaluating it um </s>
<s> from what we know of our product working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are things we need to do these the things that look like we feel are important </s>
<s> um so i was looking at basic design things does it fulfills function does a remote is the design what we wanted to do it our technologies up to where we hope they would be and is a fully extended qualities that original market research was looking for </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> basic questions like you know does it turn on doesn't respond to voice recognition and overall in general it looks like it's coming up to par um the only thing is with with the p_l_p and all that is gonna take some adjusting because in user interface </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> that looked like it was coming up rough but then once you get used to it it does make a lot of sense so i think overall we have in the right direction </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> 's hell </s>
<s> like that spongy feel </s>
<s> yeah uh it looks like it's gone almost sounds mostly works well there is a good deal here for getting a handle on yeah </s>
<s> it's i think eventually if we do um breakdown despite we we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms and house and stuff but for now all the guys working in range we needed for sound </s>
<s> so i'll go ahead </s>
<s> domain and then displayed in me losing the so um yeah et cetera </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> it is a setback but </s>
<s> okay t_d quebec um yeah which we might have lost like a normal activity </s>
<s> but the man </s>
<s> other ontologies anyway </s>
<s> uh she's true </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> right so um </s>
<s> this one's a bit and clear to me to be perfect </s>
<s> they're um </s>
<s> i got this slide </s>
<s> from the college </s>
<s> yeah and then she went connected to </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> so i guess we are going to discuss </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> uh i'm project process </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and that is going to go into my report so i guess this is the point where we go um </s>
<s> uh how'd </s>
<s> overall </s>
<s> it looks like and talk about </s>
<s> ah satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth </s>
<s> and 'kay </s>
<s> have it all worked i guess </s>
<s> as in within the team thing so yeah right so it's just kind of </s>
<s> i think it's um i kind of think the um i think so </s>
<s> it is now with your design </s>
<s> there you go </s>
<s> on the screen or picks it up </s>
<s> they just as you would open if i would say okay yeah yeah there um </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> so any thoughts </s>
<s> we can say these points yep </s>
<s> yeah okay starting locks yeah </s>
<s> when you're gets available for process </s>
<s> who's </s>
<s> oh you know i think in general for a day's worth of work we should give up relatively productive considering that little amount of input we had going in </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> um and the technology is definitely been held is really really interesting to try out all this new stuff </s>
<s> when in use the whiteboard flow </s>
<s> no we're going overboard we could now if an account for uh really if </s>
<s> yeah and i said if you guys have been designing in here perhaps of a change but because of </s>
<s> prove constraint doesn't really matter </s>
<s> uh also </s>
<s> had i not been intrigued about the pen i don't think i would use digital </s>
<s> i don't write earlier yeah i think they are seeking notes more often than usual this 'cause yeah that's true </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> it was pretty cool packed though </s>
<s> no way </s>
<s> i am disappointed in getting back to my personal coach </s>
<s> so i guess you're right personal coach yeah i mean i think there is no time </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah but look if if anything if either if you get a response two or three months </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah you get it would be kind of great easier to stick okay note anything like that i can walk encouraging is that really what if they really need it okay </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> it's like and i think there is a lot of room for creativity we can do you ever </s>
<s> they think is no longer in tilde </s>
<s> project came down on us </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and even then we did get these um product and i hope although it's not everything we wanted it to be </s>
<s> yeah with the natural log </s>
<s> it's </s>
<s> uh organic regular uh it's because it had a big data peeler in here straight at the highly resourceful teammates might i add with you always have place </s>
<s> yeah i think you have read that are like really creative actually i mean you know i've i'm impressed </s>
<s> the teamwork was good </s>
<s> to prove that we were always full we didn't waste a single bit of play-doh we use everyday </s>
<s> navy's </s>
<s> all for those little contain because yeah we've been learning is the multi color way together on every system is that we didn't have enough colors to work with </s>
<s> like </s>
<s> and therefore the yeah </s>
<s> because you begin they'll multiple since it really had been water like uh missing </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> what do you guys think about the road though though roles </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> they were good </s>
<s> yeah it's fun kind of fun </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> it was </s>
<s> i think it's pretty clever 'cause we're never able to get it </s>
<s> too far </s>
<s> off track </s>
<s> because </s>
<s> the information came at the right time </s>
<s> to kind of fill in the gaps enough </s>
<s> the same time we have enough room to kind of </s>
<s> just make things i do you will just go </s>
<s> so if you feel like the the level information dropped off severely over the course of 'kay </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> okay maybe it's just me but i didn't actually get him for fiction has presentation at all </s>
<s> they still nothing like that displaying in the name </s>
<s> like a visit </s>
<s> so yeah i feel like that was lacking but then you know </s>
<s> fill in the blanks on your own level of creativity out </s>
<s> well i think that was i think that was an issue i kept finding with regard to what to do well no but also yeah well what i know is reporting about what each of us is doing is bombing give users to what you're doing </s>
<s> in as much involvement and then i also felt like </s>
<s> you know a lot of our discussion will center around </s>
<s> the specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface where you know just what yes the whole project was about </s>
<s> yeah no very much so </s>
<s> but and then in the end i think a jealous kind of material yeah </s>
<s> that's </s>
<s> what is what </s>
<s> the most helpful thing </s>
<s> i don't everything </s>
<s> was getting there </s>
<s> the powerpoint slides a day </s>
<s> put together when you say if we have um et cetera so it okay got all that done </s>
<s> time </s>
<s> very much so </s>
<s> cool </s>
<s> yeah i think your leadership was quite good </s>
<s> it was wouldn't </s>
<s> she said i i did she actually the common often avoid getting in the same way that is true when we get back i feel like i got way too into it </s>
<s> that's kind of a bit when others have been l. y. </s>
<s> give the rest of us the structure work with sign </s>
<s> there was this other person be taking on like in a row </s>
<s> for some of everything like yeah project project management page you organize crap is one thing that you you know sever party with your friends yeah i know yeah </s>
<s> joseph </s>
<s> but you can still that you can keep </s>
<s> the </s>
<s> yeah uh suspension of disbelief kind of like like that we wanna yeah </s>
<s> x. if a couple moments were just kind of hit maybe we were a little high for exceed </s>
<s> oh yeah and i know how to make it is that with client </s>
<s> i mean this is we got the play-doh </s>
<s> but uh i only imagine </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> you know the whole concept are really trying to stick with reality went out the window in a minute </s>
<s> maybe it like us you know </s>
<s> puzzling us to like make a remote control </s>
<s> yeah or spatial appreciative spaceship like us jasmine's build speech coding like that yeah everybody knows totally that species either </s>
<s> um you guys feel like as a teamwork problem </s>
<s> yeah wrong so </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> won't </s>
<s> you know </s>
<s> no i don't know i d. i don't know i don't i i was just </s>
<s> no i didn't actually i mean other than my discussion meeting is there wasn't except for the actual building </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> but strictly like if this was a team project i should have been </s>
<s> much more declarative like brainstorming use the board </s>
<s> well this would have been six months worth of work or not </s>
<s> yeah three numbers were two meetings </s>
<s> i mean i think had they should be more serious about whether brainstorm or during meetings this year </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> 'cause unknown conscious of the idea of </s>
<s> the project manager asking </s>
<s> yeah you guys feel like there's it seems </s>
<s> can i say kind of like </s>
<s> like uh </s>
<s> we begin those kind of </s>
<s> uh yeah </s>
<s> interesting </s>
<s> kind of fascination with it </s>
<s> and the whole process of wonder why is everything about the way we got so much from it was like at this point to the </s>
<s> the board </s>
<s> i don't know what i i dunno if there was ever minus the mikes i don't feel like getting up again doing with all these wires i was afraid as accessing </s>
<s> yeah my so lucent </s>
<s> a shame to get up it's </s>
<s> so most body sending them or something contain water </s>
<s> yeah i don't know what i would have shown on the board </s>
<s> true but it didn't even occur to me is an option i mean i don't i whatever but i know that i consciously didn't </s>
<s> i mean it's just like the paper i don't know what i really needed the paper for </s>
<s> true </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> because of got this laptop </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> senator i just use the 'cause is literally right in front me </s>
<s> you always have the output files liberties um from the digital paper until my my handwriting looks like digitize because method is </s>
<s> wrap </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i mean this still looks like in </s>
<s> p. d. i've </s>
<s> format or something </s>
<s> usually i would do a lot we're dealing too but i know i felt like i needed professional sufficiently trauma in london and stuff </s>
<s> okay but not entirely </s>
<s> but step and you know what's this initially it </s>
<s> i am curious about what the de briefing is gonna be like you know like what is the uh </s>
<s> what exactly were looking for here </s>
<s> so solidly to get through </s>
<s> i don't know i'm not sure the new ideas found </s>
<s> that is about it yes </s>
<s> he did he just say newman that we need to discuss that </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> that's the thing i got in the email i got this powerpoint file but this slide was </s>
<s> yes that was like that wouldn't </s>
<s> i didn't change this one often </s>
<s> well i don't just one right track </s>
<s> um we'll </s>
<s> any new ideas with regard to </s>
<s> with her control console okay now </s>
<s> i kind of like well i think they still do their job </s>
<s> yeah you define as i am thinking outside a little square box that'll </s>
<s> but literally </s>
<s> uh in like for them </s>
<s> i yeah maybe is a circle right yeah </s>
<s> this can make you wonder i'm in </s>
<s> how much can you do with the remote control </s>
<s> taking making it cut at </s>
<s> yeah yeah you got a technically car shape working on round yeah </s>
<s> don't oh </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> um okay and the kinds of this is the back-end uh </s>
<s> i dunno </s>
<s> i think this is cool how long was i mean supposed to me how much time before you shout out and i think we should go on a bit yeah but the project eval um </s>
<s> i don't but yet but i feel like </s>
<s> a bit </s>
<s> binder stimulated on the whole thing </s>
<s> like what like you know what am i really doing </s>
<s> you know and he's </s>
<s> yeah at the beginning it started out that they'll actually like under pressure like the first couple yeah cleaning out of work and i was like they had like all these brainstorming i was doing and then suddenly as well as just another to my presentation that you guys really care motorized uh </s>
<s> uh yeah definitely you know they mean like we also yeah we read it with it so it didn't feel </s>
<s> definitely a matter when i first thought of the </s>
<s> question as marking up i higher in terms of how much i had to how much i stressed of right by the time it that's the last </s>
<s> what average in at </s>
<s> 'cause also realization of </s>
<s> we'd </s>
<s> basically just copy and paste what's given to you and your misschien </s>
<s> which uh </s>
<s> wasn't so creativity and </s>
<s> i actually didn't do that although every single one it all the presentations are either added slides or adding them </s>
<s> oh i added like five slides yeah we got like ones </s>
<s> i just got like ones that really my size world like they have a title maybe up money were just empty which you do not have that in like a man yeah they didn't come like this like with </s>
<s> this is well it's like this is those other area of it but really just sort of the </s>
<s> in one way you always look so more </s>
<s> computation for her </s>
<s> that's needed slides yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i think at the side one time </s>
<s> how many slides every time in in w. background you can have a thousand people ask last time on </s>
<s> expect </s>
<s> uh doesn't it </s>
<s> any other thoughts come to mind </s>
<s> so we know how our project for </s>
<s> here </s>
<s> i can't easily fail </s>
<s> leveraging extension socialist like that are not kate and along with it at one hundred eighty nine and if we skeptical it might be an elderly and even you would be that we kind of decided to look over like </s>
<s> fey's </s>
<s> it did occur when this happened fancy actually that looked a lot more like a time people previous to uh </s>
<s> can build another design um </s>
<s> modifications </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> i hope you appreciate the incorporation of some tin foil from a yeah okay </s>
<s> random kitty-cat the point that we can seem to be by accident </s>
<s> interesting </s>
<s> we'll huh </s>
<s> interesting day on the mel uh you know it's it's um </s>
<s> so again i reiterate mike </s>
<s> question </s>
<s> how different we are </s>
<s> compared to the other groups especially between culture </s>
<s> oops i do no </s>
<s> the um </s>
<s> it's almost everything for pretty logically </s>
<s> you know from the </s>
<s> the basics to the console up the whole concepts thing the whole concept space i don't think i really </s>
<s> and you still like the concept </s>
<s> well actually i did okay 'cause notion of functional i don't yeah i mean it's not like i have a concept of a monster material is just now </s>
<s> it is it's </s>
<s> yeah you know maybe you </s>
<s> well then concept should be should be thought we should i i thought i thought rather than in terms of concept i thought of it in terms of um </s>
<s> like </s>
<s> to propose </s>
<s> idea </s>
<s> and then the final would be like the the actual specify prototype or whatever i dunno </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> oh can i just say </s>
<s> so we have more slides </s>
<s> no just this closing won't </s>
<s> we've established that the cost were really within budget but we could </s>
<s> it's you know we got it to me </s>
<s> we didn't project evaluation based on our um </s>
<s> what separates evaluation of </s>
<s> oh close with those really technically </s>
<s> and evaluation of the product not the project </s>
<s> in general um which i'm not sure is the same thing at the time that just it made more sense but </s>
<s> i could see if they were really asking about </s>
<s> oh nice </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> 'cause unit we had if i think about it um </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> it was all recorded um yeah well though but um </s>
<s> are supposed to do this final report thing in the end so i'll put all that into the final report as well as much as </s>
<s> seems like </s>
<s> maybe not like the articles and stuff like it because it if and so forth but optimistically points </s>
<s> it be so meetings and a copy of the recording </s>
<s> uh i had done i </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> i had done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like </s>
<s> just in all the centers like that that mean nothing </s>
<s> the whole bridge or psychology or whatever that psycholinguistics </s>
<s> well the other testimony here yeah he still be close announces or something yeah </s>
<s> the call the disfluencies disfluencies are two good word for it </s>
<s> yeah we like our cats he </s>
<s> phrases and jewelers we just had to prefix this sounds class here exactly </s>
<s> i will save this into the </s>
<s> for your family citing the send receive button and </s>
<s> no i just uh yeah i can also relate to it </s>
<s> i like some yeah </s>
<s> currently some information about to be fair or work with the world on the internet </s>
<s> yeah so we don't we are addicts </s>
<s> not scarier </s>
<s> it is very obvious to on that you know we with the first ten fifteen years of our lives without the internet </s>
<s> it's only allows ten the whiteboard you get </s>
<s> i mean there are just in the past five we learned from twenty eight modems to brought back up all the time </s>
<s> in training we had internet for like eighteen years </s>
<s> no we have but i know the since it's so you know it's not right in my group here and telling me these and i got it ninety four </s>
<s> let us tell us crazy </s>
<s> yeah so </s>
<s> in the eighties </s>
<s> my um grammar does computer science back in the states and so they had um n. e. d. u. and got network um there's basically the fundamental structures but it wasn't </s>
<s> uh helpful household yet right 'cause it hadn't been </s>
<s> yeah it was just the complexity average size or something yeah </s>
<s> as haven't </s>
<s> you guys are there to celebrate </s>
<s> yeah i thought was it does that include like a very ingenious thing uh </s>
<s> sure </s>
<s> i used to have probably call them being two here and </s>
<s> i mean does it closer </s>
<s> 'cause forty minutes or </s>
<s> i was going on </s>
<s> that's all right yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i know it yeah </s>
<s> so the only song yeah </s>
<s> who's another one </s>
<s> this is windows media player </s>
<s> huh yeah </s>
<s> oh i'll so </s>
<s> i believe onto the i thought it was david girls looking really i hope that's one seems to be shipping with it but i will ship with for only the the new version </s>
<s> so that close yeah i guess so called 'kay never </s>
<s> and the meeting </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> they can read </s>
<s> you can get exciting </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> like propose the criteria </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> my family </s>
<s> okay okay everybody ready </s>
<s> shape so uh i think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves </s>
<s> yeah that's a guy and um his name and what your function is so maybe you instantly feel </s>
<s> yeah my name is francine now </s>
<s> and i and uh and user interface made all this </s>
<s> uh the </s>
<s> the main responsibilities you said interface um and my goal is to design uh uh </s>
<s> television remote control huh </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> uh the i'm the marketing person uh uh want figure out how to sell them </s>
<s> huh and your name is my name is eileen </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> yeah uh i'm generally um um my oldest industrial designer </s>
<s> and my responsibilities are up </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> deal with the technical functional design and the specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design </s>
<s> any good </s>
<s> and as you all you know i'm betsy i'm the project manager for today </s>
<s> so when we look at the presentation </s>
<s> to see what we really are supposed to do </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> yes it opening acquaintance </s>
<s> tool training while </s>
<s> tool's </s>
<s> uh i think we already </s>
<s> i guess the tool is really out of the computer um as far as i can see </s>
<s> um we get instead each of us will get instructions and will take it </s>
<s> from there </s>
<s> project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much uh um i don't think we have any great discussion at this point </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> here is what existing should be </s>
<s> the same year when </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> uh designing always a new remote control </s>
<s> and two people regional </s>
<s> um trendy </s>
<s> and of course user </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> so maybe and make some notes on that </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> here is what the functional design </s>
<s> is supposed to achieve </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> that is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting will discuss </s>
<s> what </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> we have come up with </s>
<s> the same goes for the conceptual design </s>
<s> there will be individual work </s>
<s> and then discussion afterwards </s>
<s> detailed design </s>
<s> same thing </s>
<s> three different types of design definitely concern </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> okay hypothesis </s>
<s> maybe we should redesign </s>
<s> i think </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> to finish the remote control look at it </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> then tool training tried the whiteboard </s>
<s> to control their favorite animal </s>
<s> does anybody want to go and </s>
<s> see how the whiteboard works </s>
<s> so that </s>
<s> t. case we have to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard </s>
<s> you wanna go hiding them </s>
<s> the parents that i can there </s>
<s> but you'll </s>
<s> without changing your stuff </s>
<s> since i remember how to </s>
<s> draw kitty-cat or parameters </s>
<s> but </s>
<s> and remember you have to press so we were though 'cause it and then </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> that fact that uh i think that uh </s>
<s> verify </s>
<s> yeah yeah </s>
<s> six five </s>
<s> okay that 'kay </s>
<s> 'kay in your </s>
<s> front seemed nice i mean yeah i mean like just to see and hear how it feels so that you have a little idea </s>
<s> um i was aware of </s>
<s> oh no </s>
<s> no not okay </s>
<s> get to that later </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> so that uh </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> things need acting aggressively </s>
<s> oh yeah </s>
<s> i don't think you together in groups that are like this </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> is a project finance uh which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing </s>
<s> um 'em selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro </s>
<s> um profit aim for the company he's fifty million euro </s>
<s> market grange unlimited </s>
<s> leading international </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve </s>
<s> fifty euro </s>
<s> okay and that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged them no </s>
<s> in </s>
<s> so these are holding the things of course you're </s>
<s> to remember is the budget and when you design </s>
<s> to </s>
<s> materials cost etcetera </s>
<s> now </s>
<s> uh discussion i guess he's </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> does any one of you have experience with </s>
<s> remote control </s>
<s> they're goes </s>
<s> as it is even the user we use them right everyday </s>
<s> uh and uh </s>
<s> now </s>
<s> having used in a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea </s>
<s> like things you didn't like with it's things you would like to change things really like to improve with this thing yeah i d. first ideas </s>
<s> you likely be smaller </s>
<s> bigger </s>
<s> yeah i have more buttons on it or or maybe clearly better mark </s>
<s> but um it's you know things like that </s>
<s> yeah i i feel that the remote should be maybe come back to smaller right those which we get yet nowadays it's very long </s>
<s> h_m_m and 'em </s>
<s> and it should have multipurpose like add that a remote control materials but the way it should uh it should be used for uh for some other purpose also like </s>
<s> controlling uh uh decoration inside the house of it at condition as of a heating system so it should be a multi-functional </s>
<s> uh a gadget is that it was uh control your household uh machines basically exactly </s>
<s> all the tone </s>
<s> twelve </s>
<s> fifty euros </s>
<s> for </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> well you know it's we get a really good so maybe we can do that </s>
<s> we certainly can turn to a group of it to market something successful it should do some more it should be something new should be it should do something different then then just folded happy now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design yeah design should be yeah it should be displayed on the almost like a train you know like another thirty every so maybe to be something trendy you know maybe in different colors or materials to our you know </s>
<s> um so yeah shapes right you know like keep the shape file better in your hand or something else in terms of shape yeah </s>
<s> that would help </s>
<s> i think another thing that would help is always </s>
<s> if </s>
<s> it </s>
<s> beeps when you clap </s>
<s> because i think one of the big things that happens is able to use them they can't find it </s>
<s> that is true </s>
<s> they put a newspaper or they put it behind a planet or we or whatever and and there are some in the phone rings and they want to turn the t_v off and see why </s>
<s> place </s>
<s> my remote control yeah </s>
<s> well or yeah or if it's really </s>
<s> if it's really had dark spot </s>
<s> that he keeps out that uh sounds or signals and yeah definitely to tell you last slide should be when you lost uh signal is it me or so it was signal you know and and maybe to have a light so that we can </s>
<s> we can just recognize abilities </s>
<s> exactly i mean just the arms as i say i'm just saying no signal meaning just whether it's uh people whether daylight savings and i'll good </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> clue for the is that </s>
<s> it would respond to </s>
<s> clap </s>
<s> or respond </s>
<s> to your voice </s>
<s> or would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or point okay my my idea is maybe that </s>
<s> the minute it's really hidden in in other words if it's </s>
<s> like </s>
<s> in a dark spot </s>
<s> it's um </s>
<s> uh meaning you know like newspaper is on top a sweater is on top or it's it's behind the plan </s>
<s> at that moment it's it's like it's like uh um what you call it the light set the sensors you know in in that mode it has a sensor if it gets a certain darkness </s>
<s> it has a sensor and it gives out a signal </s>
<s> whether that be a light signal or a beep i mean that we can discuss this later you know </s>
<s> and so there were times where </s>
<s> after the the signal that's right and you know it would be </s>
<s> right you have to have some kind of sensor </s>
<s> and i i think your uh voice or clapping that's not specific enough </s>
<s> uh i know they're the lambs and stuff you know you can live on and off </s>
<s> but i think the only work </s>
<s> to certain degree </s>
<s> it could be some place really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find </s>
<s> what was it isn't </s>
<s> well because this is because you silly because people are oh yeah well but then those can you can help by everybody </s>
<s> like on top of your bookcase and usually kept it on the coffee table </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> you know but we had we had to move along with them and it will but i think we have some good good points to start with him </s>
<s> okay the next meeting will be in thirty minutes i think you'll do you get the notices on your computer this okay so will you that the note is um </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> the working design </s>
<s> i guess that's the function i d. </s>
<s> uh who is this the industrial designer </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i that's you </s>
<s> yeah its functionality yeah exactly okay so </s>
<s> we are looking for working design when we come back </s>
<s> uh looking nice and yeah it sounded </s>
<s> they did with the functional design and then the technical functions you the technical functions those and so you are the working design so we are working design </s>
<s> and then a functional design </s>
<s> and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirements specification like french </s>
<s> yes and what we just discussed in general </s>
<s> that would be you're </s>
<s> idea </s>
<s> and of course price </s>
<s> but they said that the price is a good price um i mean the price is given but </s>
<s> the that we 's </s>
<s> we have to justify that that's right uh having sufficient features to make it so that that's right </s>
<s> and you know this but you you will get specifically um </s>
<s> instructions for that i think that's the end of the show </s>
<s> so uh 'em </s>
<s> we have well we have a </s>
<s> fine </s>
<s> two two two three minutes </s>
<s> um any questions at this point or uh </s>
<s> suggestions </s>
<s> um i think basically </s>
<s> basically you will get instructions </s>
<s> to work with </s>
<s> and if you have any questions or </s>
<s> okay supreme </s>
<s> okay i think i have </s>
<s> to think about our next meeting </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> no two people yeah islamic yeah </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> right well observations </s>
<s> then uh i see you in about thirty minutes </s>
<s> and see what we can come up with um okay really </s>
<s> okay yeah </s>
<s> so many of your uh </s>
<s> predicted this now i think we have to keep it yeah </s>
<s> let's </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> people </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> seven clearly ready yeah </s>
<s> just uh it's is it okay </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> i take it you all have </s>
<s> received instructions as to what </s>
<s> more specifically </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> uh in </s>
<s> i finished the marketing manager progress report </s>
<s> first </s>
<s> addressing the needs and desires </s>
<s> okay register now </s>
<s> yeah ma'am </s>
<s> okay i'll put you on with my slides up 'cause i think it might be helpful and uh we looked at the slides at the same time okay </s>
<s> participant four percent for it </s>
<s> he's um </s>
<s> okay well i think he's </s>
<s> and introduced ourselves so the functional requirements uh </s>
<s> uh he's </s>
<s> is board michael but whatever pastor to the second slide </s>
<s> 'cause that's where my discussions with my well um since i'm in charge of trying to figure out what </s>
<s> we should put on those things as i have to try to sell it </s>
<s> um i thought that they meant that i should follow each other suggestions for everybody </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> the reason i just put that there are like uh a uh he's </s>
<s> the uh initially in the initial stage i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions you could say anything you want them or how silly it sounds and her children your car chip heat up your moderate chip </s>
<s> um turn on to see what africa pop it into um and then as we go on </s>
<s> all will have to do is except eliminate these suggestions according to um design budget feasibility so i'll be coming to you um frequently as the industrial expert jeremy </s>
<s> how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time is takes five years to develop this is just something you can't do </s>
<s> so in the beginning just have a big </s>
<s> total of things that we </s>
<s> anybody can throw anything in them and just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another and then the things that seem the most attractive that </s>
<s> to uh to a customer </s>
<s> but rather than prioritize those times so that was um what i meant there </s>
<s> uh as i said on the slide there are consulting industrial engineer about that </s>
<s> and yeah i think he's time is really gonna be as important as money because if we're gonna sell this thing </s>
<s> i think the best time to sell this is christmas present </s>
<s> twenty five euros makes a nice little present </s>
<s> and we wanted to be an impulse purchase we want somebody to see it and think it's gee i just gotta have that </s>
<s> and take other well and buy it so it's gonna be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by september 'cause anything that you don't have already out there in september showing it around isn't gonna sell for christmas </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and then i'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me you from your point of view </s>
<s> what </s>
<s> ah the most friendly features that we could put on it </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> try to </s>
<s> prior helping with a prioritize in fact uh of uh of the features a lot of the work and the color and </s>
<s> i'll be coming back to your to help me delta suggestions from that point of here so we can reach you for how much is it gonna cost and how long is it gonna take you </s>
<s> and i'll be coming to you to jeremy </s>
<s> what can i maybe let somebody take out there well i you know what what what what's gonna really be </s>
<s> what they called us is all fit together still this is all </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of here is in the thing that somebody is really just gonna take a farewell and buy for christmas for </s>
<s> for their child or for the husband or whatever it's okay we go to the next slide please </s>
<s> i i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas </s>
<s> and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the whole the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible </s>
<s> so i'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where are we saying you could suggest anything like this suggestions to be really specific </s>
<s> so that will have a list of things we can cross off not something like you know whole house control </s>
<s> watching </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> and then i found on the internet from for my research that some extent electronic entertainment control should be possible </s>
<s> at the budget that we're looking at that the price point were like yeah we should be able to make it work for t_v c. or the stereo set </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other plans or maybe only </s>
<s> can i add this one way to interject um something um we have received instructions from higher up that certain things should not be </s>
<s> i consider it </s>
<s> okay uh the the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext because that's sort of updated </s>
<s> okay into it </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> according to to higher management </s>
<s> the it should only control the t_v </s>
<s> mostly because they feel that leads to clump complex the task to um to to include other things </s>
<s> and they are concerned with the time to market </s>
<s> of course i okay </s>
<s> uh so and the and the third saying that they want to make sure </s>
<s> um that they have that the corporate image is being maintained and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product </s>
<s> so that it easy </s>
<s> but that </s>
<s> that they can be easily identified as a product of of </s>
<s> of of the company and that there's no mistake but it could be somebody else was bringing this out </s>
<s> so i just wanted to check this here so we not getting </s>
<s> too much off track here with uh with the things you wanna look at these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things without only gonna be t_v </s>
<s> but the one thing maybe that could be uh maybe is a teletext uh idea </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> ah i think uh </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> ah no other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about remote controls that are out there now </s>
<s> it's a lot of um take too much time to learn how to use </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> that was thirty four percent any more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room </s>
<s> um so those are two things that we definitely do you want to address </s>
<s> uh we wanna make it as simple as possible to make it um obvious and intuitive to use </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> then the </s>
<s> things 'bout finding out </s>
<s> we talked about uh a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe beep </s>
<s> and i think that those things after more research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate clicking on the next slide please </s>
<s> okay so my personal preferences in this um project </s>
<s> are we really have to concentrate on the sizzle </s>
<s> that is the selling point the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase </s>
<s> uh because once there's now be back bone cells they always say no </s>
<s> the back still come back </s>
<s> is all this is all come back and get the next week you there </s>
<s> they never gonna come back and bite you gotta make it attractive enough that they by now now now now was a big worry </s>
<s> in my book for selling this thing </s>
<s> and in order to make it really sellable we've got to shorten the learning curve make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use </s>
<s> we have to have as few buttons as possible </s>
<s> because more buttons is more confusion so that's why i'm saying simplicity is good </s>
<s> finding its important obviously can't use of can't find it </s>
<s> so gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it </s>
<s> and i've already said this several times but i put it on writing here should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros </s>
<s> so it has to have enough value there </s>
<s> when somebody looks at it this uh twenty five euros are not gonna take that </s>
<s> has to be so great </s>
<s> that they're gonna say twenty five euros as much </s>
<s> um uh and then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use our marketing campaign </s>
<s> okay that's about it for me right now </s>
<s> oh they've </s>
<s> yeah and uh </s>
<s> who would be next uh </s>
<s> i guess that would um </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> you want me to get your schedule ish thank you </s>
<s> uh yeah that's </s>
<s> three number two </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> okay my stuff was clean </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> yeah let's like </s>
<s> yes yeah </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> sure yeah i know what time </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> uh so today i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller </s>
<s> okay um </s>
<s> go to the next slide slide this isn't </s>
<s> the method is like uh in a remote control you have a chip integrated so cute which is like a pre after the remote control and it takes the power from a battery c. battery it can't be and and like an electric supply like you have to uh like uh the switch it can it can it can connect your uh remote controller to uh power supply from that you know electricity or something like that it should be a battery </s>
<s> because uh the remote control should be like you you you should take it to to read what you want and then uh uh the this integrated circuit it it takes energy from the power source and or whatever like if you press a button it's like the input for the remote control and it takes the input and </s>
<s> it transforms into a in front in front of weights and sends it it to the device like t_v ordered a condition or something like that so uh remote controller is specifically designed to a single device if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequencies </s>
<s> like uh the the remote control it sends some but some </s>
<s> uh behaves like at a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is the chip </s>
<s> figure three to recognize that </s>
<s> uh waves which are coming from the remote control and it should be the action like if you press a button channel or something like that </s>
<s> then uh the remote uh remote control will send the sender uh to sort of the signal and the t_v it should </s>
<s> translate that into like change </s>
<s> the channel or something like that change the volume control um </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> uh so uh i think it's hard to design a remote control for multiple uh devices </s>
<s> yeah yeah that's already been a one minute yeah management cells are often </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> so uh user interface controls the chip </s>
<s> and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user interface like uh you know switch pad or something like that but and should be there so you can control what do what you want you want to change the channel you want to control the what you do you want to go to new new the t_v all you want to have a child lock all you want to do some operations this it should there should be some device to tell it what to do to the uh in uh </s>
<s> integrated so cube so that the integrated circuit can just send the signals and t_v can perform there </s>
<s> actions </s>
<s> so can you go to the next slide please </s>
<s> 's i i just would like </s>
<s> to uh add some extra features to the remote control and uh i think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um uh investment also it's like no </s>
<s> the text of buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote control or the </s>
<s> those we can make </s>
<s> uh uh like florescent </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> uh they'll be light light emitting if it is dark so that you can find you out </s>
<s> remote control </s>
<s> if it is dark </s>
<s> and uh there should be a beep </s>
<s> as many buttons are pressed if suppose chinese being with the the remote control and uh she she or he is pressing the buttons on at the time then there should be a beep seeing that it's the this is not uh oh well you know uh </s>
<s> oh action did they can be more action taking do that so </s>
<s> and there should be a child lock </s>
<s> like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh </s>
<s> and that what they were buttons are pressed away a child that can't be leaving you you if you if you have to keep kids and on and they be living with remote control or so </s>
<s> can log </s>
<s> there are two hundred </s>
<s> yes to make it usable for more than one device so it's hard but </s>
<s> that it's possible yeah well that has in it yeah that's eliminated so that's that's it </s>
<s> question yeah pointing out um and uh different sheet that we can do like uh we can have you know at all any machines or you know comfortable </s>
<s> even if it's can fit in d. r. hansen </s>
<s> um i was added a marketing point of views yeah yeah function in colors also different uh it's just that one had too much to the budget to normally should i don't think it would be like you can have you know for that if you wanted just they'll they'll basically yeah yeah and it's not just just cheap so it doesn't matter as a bunch of it looking at if you </s>
<s> filled one well they don't remember to make a big difference was gonna be square or </s>
<s> do you think there's any chance of um having surgery had basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes </s>
<s> yeah that is also has a slightly an idea that might make it more likely we will have to get a budget on that but i think in principle that that would be that would be kind of funny because we had something sort of sexy for adults who have something sort of silly for silly for children they can analyze jail and then tell you a little elephant so they can remember where it is </s>
<s> and you okay </s>
<s> and and uh the button buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons if there are more buttons and then it will be more complicated if you have less features than your remote control you won't be attractive so i think we need to make some buttons which are which are like i'll them uh for </s>
<s> uh in a thing didn't for two or three operations like if you press one button in one more then it will change the channel if you press the other button and and have them or it will change the color so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will </s>
<s> complicate the matter more than it is now i think i think that that's something that we have discussed only when the user interface person is i think there's a lot of our directory image for uh one button for one feature so i think one of the things people were complaining about my when i found out my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one yeah </s>
<s> the changing modes was so it's like yeah i mean you know all for all four of us who work with computers all the time changing modes is nothing for us for people who are a little elderly a little less thrifty and you know and </s>
<s> and it's a small button and and then they don't press it exactly you know something else happens and not their favorite channel comes up or something else and they are very frustrated and somehow i think you will remember feel </s>
<s> and um yeah i mean you don't you don't feel the change so um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be of help yeah shapes also differentials the triangle is for the volume of the squares for changing channels and so that people can um yeah uh develop a tactile sense of it but we'll get to that if you've and also takes should be really clear so that they they won't be any ambiguities that's right yeah no that's a good ones </s>
<s> and uh display clock about it if you want more features then we can display o'clock it i i don't think it will taking money extra money because anyway we haven't included so good i think we can just definitely feedback features into the circuit here that's that's a good that's a good um because the clock on a really friendly is </s>
<s> when when is your favorite channel coming up </s>
<s> indeed </s>
<s> i didn't know whether there is uh a lot of time is not o'clock on the screen and you go somewhere where you just wanna look at the news for a minute yeah that's that's good the corpus going </s>
<s> okay can you go to the next slide please </s>
<s> uh components are the main components we need for uh uh don't like buttons </s>
<s> and that uh underneath that there should be sweets </s>
<s> and uh bud's </s>
<s> like i'll be can have a bug like whenever we are operating the remote control or or </s>
<s> uh whenever the t_v 's on suppose then uh the remote controller should automatically have on sort of a light </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> then it will be like if you switch on your t_v to another another so was not from tool a remote remote control menu you lost your remote control and maybe you can find them in the light </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> maybe we can have that whenever the t_vs on remote control will have a light </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and then uh infrared bonds and um this is like uh when it is done yeah </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and the battery there should be a battery for power supply </s>
<s> and a chip </s>
<s> chip which is like comparing to the remote controller which does all calculations </s>
<s> and vice connecting got chips which is </s>
<s> uh light everything so there should be wires </s>
<s> and um of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and you know different shapes or whatever the base station be keys differ </s>
<s> the givenchy the remote yeah </s>
<s> he's </s>
<s> 'kay scored and would have in the folder yeah </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> next slide please </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> i have for for the site </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> the whole page of the </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> uh i site uh from it i have uh </s>
<s> i got so few points </s>
<s> um is it not funny </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> so um we should visit the site and have a look at uh some uh um </s>
<s> oh paper from uh it's not like that i have referred to be used to get new ideas and so maybe what what can be done working design too </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> worked out designs so it might be helpful to have a look at them </s>
<s> so if you want </s>
<s> okay 'cause to </s>
<s> did you go back to that slide wishing that that those set up that's it </s>
<s> uh it's actually then uh </s>
<s> did on the screen on this one </s>
<s> yeah okay thinking </s>
<s> using this thing do </s>
<s> yeah uh you have to </s>
<s> no nine three </s>
<s> twenty four individuals for these yeah </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> as uh user interface designer i did a little research to find out what other features which uh you still would like to have on the remote </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> yeah he is goldman's </s>
<s> i find that </s>
<s> uh uh the the main purpose of our remote is to uh </s>
<s> control of the function of like television </s>
<s> at a far enough distance that you would distance </s>
<s> no for that uh remote control i should have a switch on off back to </s>
<s> but the user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t. v. and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t_v </s>
<s> there should be a signal to uh or something like that you'll be able order infrared light a delay which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume you can change it </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> yeah they should be sometime like the set for viewing the politically a particular program last switching on and off of uh particular program according to the user </s>
<s> also i was on the remote so yes yes </s>
<s> if if a model view a particular program that say and i know clown you can set the time ran the t_v will automatically research on at that particular time um </s>
<s> so you can use that kind of uh properties of features </s>
<s> and then there should be a try out system if a particular channel is not to be anywhere a particular uh phone set in each then debating scan the log that particular channel so that that children cannot view them agenda </s>
<s> um i'm uh the uh the uh and the one of the features a user would like to have is the compactness of the got a remote </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and the remote should be compact and it should not it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t. v. television </s>
<s> and uh but uh as uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of fifty an alphabet for more compact ability </s>
<s> um he's </s>
<s> and uh and uh and ate this one will point which i noted it down like uh the material which it to which is used for what should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something centered energy </s>
<s> by the children onto um independent classes and </s>
<s> and it should have then uh it can have an alarm clock </s>
<s> uh but i sent it so that if somebody wants to get up but down deep eight b. and then you can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock and i don't think it would cost too much to set an alarm clock is that a remote shell </s>
<s> if there is a compliment me on the whole smoking as john reset the buttons can be uh can make </s>
<s> we can use the for order since </s>
<s> but like that the back-end is so different </s>
<s> uh but there's but glow differently so even in that the user can know what buttons to use the search on a particular channel </s>
<s> and uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that they should not being shot projections </s>
<s> so that if a child plays with a little more </s>
<s> he he he should not </s>
<s> be harmed in any way </s>
<s> findings </s>
<s> uh i found out uh um and different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used that adam was which you use the infrared bit for controlling the different functionalities and adding words which used a video these different protocols </s>
<s> friends </s>
<s> i'm yeah </s>
<s> so there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which i use which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of the television </s>
<s> you've </s>
<s> many of them have field lessons </s>
<s> references like it can be used for a multi purpose use </s>
<s> not </s>
<s> i know and like it it can be used as a t_v controller as well as an alarm clock </s>
<s> to set and then um a line and it should have a try block </s>
<s> and then to save electricity uh they should not be uh matched movement lots of circuits and all that </s>
<s> and if the person is as if it's wise the television to be switched off by ten o'clock </s>
<s> then it should be switched off then up at ten o'clock automatically so that nobody else um sit there and use it </s>
<s> okay its like a time and time again diamonds and allow god to the television set down there as well </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> on my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda </s>
<s> yeah and uh on the closing </s>
<s> uh basically they have the lunch break and all that </s>
<s> however </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> the decision we have to take in this meeting is </s>
<s> cool he's our target group </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> what function working design 'em </s>
<s> how how does it work </s>
<s> so these are the two things we should come up with with </s>
<s> so uh </s>
<s> the first thing is for maybe a little easier on the who is our target group </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> i guess in many ways everybody </s>
<s> everybody who has a t_v t_v television is yeah and i think today they're probably not many people who don't have a t_v yeah they are few but in general laughed </s>
<s> now talking about the target group </s>
<s> which is </s>
<s> in a sense everybody but i think within the target group </s>
<s> we have subgroup 's </s>
<s> we have we have earlier it was mentioned about uh um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands </s>
<s> so i think that's uh at one point </s>
<s> that is certainly important </s>
<s> i uh 'em </s>
<s> then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything </s>
<s> um unless it's really very clear </s>
<s> and uh i don't know </s>
<s> how much we want to cater to chose ensues </s>
<s> i mean that's a question </s>
<s> um with her that's </s>
<s> important that children can really use it </s>
<s> on on </s>
<s> so these these are just some thoughts i have on it and um </s>
<s> i don't know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group </s>
<s> and for this one target will be gonna design this one thing </s>
<s> or whether we looking at </s>
<s> it will be like we've been talking about different shapes um with that different shape also includes maybe different </s>
<s> uh button's them </s>
<s> uh for </s>
<s> different groups </s>
<s> well you know there's they'll motto children under six never shop along um so if you design something that's very attractive to children </s>
<s> um there mommy please mommy please um </s>
<s> you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see that </s>
<s> uh um that has uh a lot um </s>
<s> had a lot of getting paul that had a lot of appeal but i think </s>
<s> uh i'm i'm talking about the functionality now on it with are we looking at different groups i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape um and with colors that's right you know like you make it nice and paint flores and banana color or whatever </s>
<s> but initially like yesterday this example you know but the question is really who is our target group </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> do we look at one target group </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> with a twenty five euros you know can we can we afford to have </s>
<s> uh i messed with the technical people here whether </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> is to look at </s>
<s> the sort of sub groups always may be different buttons for each group </s>
<s> how much would that throw us </s>
<s> out of the cost we are supposed to </s>
<s> respect respect </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> gently begin begin design a remote which is mainly for the better but the for each from our gain to um forty right and and then begin add on our specific functional but then split children as well as the elderly people other people but it with </s>
<s> we have noticed rather maybe we can design different remotes for different people like for each to be there there will be big buttons and you know well </s>
<s> carnegie i mean there would be a schlesinger regimen in middle age but you're not likely different remotes </s>
<s> they would like to buy just one </s>
<s> and uh just one which can be used by all the three yeah of course that we can </s>
<s> do but specifically if if </s>
<s> like elderly people want a big buttons then you can't really make a big big remote control </s>
<s> so maybe specific and you can design and </s>
<s> a remote control living for children </s>
<s> what about the question marks that's not really valentine's day much and it it doesn't cost and out that without watching much work on this doesn't </s>
<s> as in the question the question to be addressed here is a link with a target group and how will it function um </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> i think so how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know yeah are within the target group or sub groups </s>
<s> the question is only whether our budget will allow </s>
<s> to </s>
<s> have </s>
<s> more than one design in the sense yeah i mean the basic design we understand will be the same but the question is how much will that set us back you would say uh </s>
<s> forty percent remake large buttons and the rest we make regular bargains for example now </s>
<s> so that remains to be seen but </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> target group </s>
<s> as a wall 's </s>
<s> it's basically everybody was a t_v that's or </s>
<s> this can we can really is it even feasible to make </s>
<s> why 'em in one remote control with something for everyone </s>
<s> or we have to use the same electronics and make three different shape yeah well that's that's already in the same electronics and basic are always gonna be different is the plastic case and in that case we can </s>
<s> problem's </s>
<s> molded plastic is not all that expensive is it </s>
<s> no no no i and i don't think and um </s>
<s> well maybe there's there's next year </s>
<s> and you know that's the new for example new portable phones um </s>
<s> they have like removal </s>
<s> plastic cases yeah you can have a striped what are you can have the fluorescent blue wound or whatever and maybe something like that that each package you know you have uh there's a real you you have you have for example uh would you you have let's say for a simpler one it </s>
<s> but then you have uh another color stripe whatever that already comes in a package </s>
<s> and then if people really want more colors they can buy it separately </s>
<s> right yeah like little biphones yes have uh different you know colors so that they can do that to identify like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the stripe or whatever they have as another one in the package </s>
<s> and they can go to the store for a few uh </s>
<s> francs or euros whatever they can buy a delta back and alternate package with another two colors in it you know for example i dunno yeah </s>
<s> but </s>
<s> uh yeah i i have adopted a little bit because lies effective if we if we design i didn't more having all of the </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> different </s>
<s> features for different people on designing three different um </s>
<s> remotes for three different categories of </s>
<s> people well i think i think the idea is to do to design one remote to you and what the only change is gonna be uh um the final project it took yeah i have to update the functional uh functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way yeah um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people </s>
<s> uh i live with children um </s>
<s> i think he's that was i guess that </s>
<s> but still message </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> but if you have um </s>
<s> uh i'm </s>
<s> we may have to come back to uh </s>
<s> only and the ones that are groups within the um but i think if we do some more research i i think disarming up the target group is basically everybody </s>
<s> if money permits we can uh address some features for some sub groups uh within that um </s>
<s> yeah preliminary seventy percent is a unique uh um do we can agree on that on that in principle like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not tokens </s>
<s> okay so now i understand that lunch break </s>
<s> yeah i'm them </s>
<s> so that's what women do </s>
<s> so thank you very much yeah </s>
<s> and well see you after lunch </s>
<s> to </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i just </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> hello everyone huh </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> how uh how you doing </s>
<s> oh good </s>
<s> uh first requiring uh over there </s>
<s> minutes of the last </s>
<s> my more or less um </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> in the last meeting uh the marketing </s>
<s> matcher </s>
<s> at present k_l_t </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> here're </s>
<s> method of working meaning gathering it suggestions </s>
<s> from every one to see how she best could marker it </s>
<s> uh there's </s>
<s> this product </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> the within the budget and that was given </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> in general </s>
<s> the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> it also an item that people lose a lot </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> we should address that </s>
<s> and of course it should </s>
<s> be </s>
<s> something </s>
<s> that is very simple to use </s>
<s> in addition to that to make it </s>
<s> sell of course so uh the marketing manager </s>
<s> which says that it's be very attractive for like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another </s>
<s> so that'd </s>
<s> people are buying it now </s>
<s> because in particular we smaller items that's very important fact </s>
<s> 'cause uh if they say well uh like a home and think about it that won't work </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> also mentioned was it should be </s>
<s> uh it should have a very short learning curve </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> maybe it could be sold by using a slogan </s>
<s> our </s>
<s> technical manager has </s>
<s> then said that she feels it should have a chip </s>
<s> that has infrared </s>
<s> bit's </s>
<s> it has an interface controls with interface that controls the chip </s>
<s> therefore message 's </s>
<s> um will be controlled in the same manner </s>
<s> you should be extra features likely buttons maybe it be okay if too many buttons are pressed </s>
<s> um uh uh child lock </s>
<s> uh hum </s>
<s> and uh </s>
<s> maybe a display clock </s>
<s> so that people could 'em </s>
<s> you could see the time you know what show they want to watch </s>
<s> also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes </s>
<s> so the components of the thing should be button box input the infrared box battery chips </s>
<s> wires and maybe some kind of a holder </s>
<s> uh for the </s>
<s> for the uh </s>
<s> i'd um </s>
<s> when she now who's an hour </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> interface interface </s>
<s> this designer </s>
<s> uh um </s>
<s> uh has mentioned that </s>
<s> the </s>
<s> that of course should have a on-off button </s>
<s> and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe channel lock </s>
<s> particularly obvious maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable </s>
<s> it should be compaq per person so </s>
<s> favorite was it would be key shaped </s>
<s> and maybe have an ah alarm clock </s>
<s> and so material should possibly be enough of no never achieved nature </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> the different systems uh that exist are infrared or radio waves </s>
<s> uh maybe it should have uh electric electricity electricity saving </s>
<s> feature i'm </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> even possibly a timer </s>
<s> to so that people can program </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> their favorite uh </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> program of 'em right from the remote </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time um okay </s>
<s> pretty much is known </s>
<s> okay then we </s>
<s> i am looking for three presentations and uh i don't know whether the order matters much </s>
<s> uh i don't </s>
<s> i don't think so so whoever wants to </s>
<s> yeah okay </s>
<s> i snuck in his uh </s>
<s> handyman </s>
<s> sorry </s>
<s> that number two </s>
<s> three </s>
<s> three </s>
<s> yeah as an interface design and i would give more emphasis on interface how the remote looks like </s>
<s> so that it descended then it is attractive to customers </s>
<s> next week </s>
<s> okay now that one </s>
<s> no effort involved is to send messages to the television </s>
<s> this messages could be a switch on off my seat i switch to next channel message us that being the channel is a switching line to a particular channel like you can have the numbers whiteboard three four up to nine </s>
<s> nine what nine channel uh </s>
<s> 's which is </s>
<s> okay um </s>
<s> nine channels which is yes yeah nine numbers um </s>
<s> and then you have slapping uh more but then </s>
<s> my deducing which you can slap the channels if we don't want to see this telegenic is map it to the for gender or vice lesser </s>
<s> then you should have uh next to but then the next but didn't standard that that you can keep on uh um uh scrolling the channels one by one </s>
<s> next slide please </s>
<s> then you should have a but then that should which get which can be used for increasing or decreasing the while you um </s>
<s> then they should be backed in which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on and everybody should for example if you are watching the french program and you would like to have a a sub type is in english </s>
<s> then there should be a channel which can doing this mechanism in the television so that the user can see </s>
<s> and that yeah the subtitles on this can be </s>
<s> then they should there there should be some buttons which gain control of features like the color </s>
<s> i don't out the picture the contrast sharpness brightness </s>
<s> of the picture </s>
<s> yeah they should be on the middle east village </s>
<s> there should be a mute but then suddenly if if if uh you know he gets a telephone call </s>
<s> and if you wanted doesn't want to switch off the </s>
<s> uh t_v but he he can reduce the sound begin </s>
<s> being the winding down and inbox speaking now by talking enlarge the t_v </s>
<s> not the most important feature that i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature </s>
<s> it's an integrated program programmable sample sensor uh speaker unit </s>
<s> so the remote can be can be uh designed which can had the y. selected denies that is </s>
<s> you can record your own voice </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> which can be recognized by as a voice recognizer in the television for example if you want to see the if you want to see the ninth agenda if you say just say nine gender </s>
<s> as it had the uh yeah the remote will automatically the switch to the nite agenda um so the d_v_d had some recognizer which are recognized they uses wise and according to change its functionalities none of this is one of the very important feature anymore </s>
<s> then draw again have </s>
<s> so this is one of the one of the interface </s>
<s> which can be created </s>
<s> um as a decent interface which has all the uh uh important features </s>
<s> live in the same um </s>
<s> then these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and color but they have may need back then is um sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognize which button is for what function and all that so you can you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user-friendly even a kid can use that </s>
<s> instead of getting gone twenty minutes late </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> so this is one of the interface that i didn't want which has this byte wise i think that now is that um and this has multipurpose use it can be used for t_v can be used for cable satellite it can be used for b. c. i. d. v. d.s and audio </s>
<s> and this has inbuilt voice recognizer </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> we didn't see any </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> no this is an interface for to try to have fun adding looked uh uh object i can use um now this is yourself and it's very attractive and the children can use it as it is they can be a bit </s>
<s> and this comes with different </s>
<s> dallas different shapes </s>
<s> and this this giant the interface has a minimum buttons </s>
<s> and i'll be important </s>
<s> uh the buttons are dead and the small compact </s>
<s> attractive </s>
<s> giant interface </s>
<s> so here's </s>
<s> now this is a making it almost i assume what it's cannot be misplaced but it's impossible </s>
<s> exactly </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> the idea of it is that </s>
<s> not a big again </s>
<s> is it better to this w. as a remote control it's impossible to get misplaced on certain </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> with those buttons that interfaces can be created </s>
<s> and plus the professors </s>
<s> um would be </s>
<s> s. p. uh to incorporate speech recognizers </s>
<s> average response to use this voice for a particular uh function </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> we didn't that's </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> okay thank you very much uh any comments on their presentation </s>
<s> well um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there </s>
<s> um well </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> i'm </s>
<s> no suggestions bad yeah but are we gonna have to narrow it down a little more i don't think that we can get </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> 'kay shape is good the child is good </s>
<s> so too big to misplace i think is just funny </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> i don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter is going to be a little bit normally all these are representation about the uh as far as the decision making we get down to combine to learn after again but if i just wanted to know whether anybody had any he any anything to add to her no i think the presentation was grouping machine really explore all the options oh </s>
<s> how was the next uh </s>
<s> yeah um okay and you only see that too </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and the next one suburbs thinks is good </s>
<s> components design um </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> this time i'm i'm going to um </s>
<s> concentrate more on the components um and the technical side of the remote control the design </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> to the next one please </s>
<s> i have just a brief uh dollar few uh components which we require for the remote control that construction </s>
<s> and the first one is case </s>
<s> to keep all the components like integrated circular battery it's a fight set rides like uh it can be a plastic one hard plastic </s>
<s> so that it can be strong even if you just uh well you know if you </s>
<s> if it falls down then it doesn't </s>
<s> three so it should be strong and uh uh the more harmful materials used in that </s>
<s> and it should be recycled </s>
<s> uh and um we're yeah uh and also uh using of cutting component components like uh if we want to have different colors blue red green </s>
<s> still uh uh we have to use a some kind of component component components </s>
<s> and uh the second important thing is that uh uh integrated so cute </s>
<s> uh they should we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote control or if it is not a fish and then everything is going to be uh like out in the left is less efficient so if you should we should have a highly sophisticated one </s>
<s> and it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures suppose or if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degrees outside the chip </s>
<s> it should be able to address is the temperature better uh </s>
<s> tyson's </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> i cambridge and go down to just </s>
<s> and uh it should be with uh um a clip of it statement an alarm facility </s>
<s> and the uh on the component we should know if we have in the remote control is that a sister </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> which is like uh it it is very very much important for the electricity uh overflow to to to the remote controller and also a capacitor which is um </s>
<s> it isn't i think it's it's like a battery capacitor </s>
<s> and you're going to the next slide please move </s>
<s> uh i tell you what </s>
<s> a transistor </s>
<s> and resonator these at all this uh technical uh elektra electronic components of the components which have which we have to use in a remote control that </s>
<s> a battery uh i would like to suggest one thing uh if we </s>
<s> uh if we will be able to make a three state rechargeable battery than because we need not go for um high performance battery even if it doesn't low performance battery it kind kind can be kind charge much it it it's not a hollywood respectively then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then the people can use it for a long time so in that maybe can cut at the cost effective at at and that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one </s>
<s> and we we have a circuit board </s>
<s> uh in a remote control that can go to the next slide please </s>
<s> and how it works how the remote controller works </s>
<s> when you press a button </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> uh when you press a button when you do that </s>
<s> you complete a specific connection that means when you </s>
<s> when you press a button that will be on the small side cute </s>
<s> underneath the button and it will send some signals to the wires </s>
<s> and then the chip will sense that connection and most that fits button is pressed suppose you have pressed channel one button number one you have placed in the uh the chip will know that the number one button was pressed it pros it produces some more morse code line signal specific to that button </s>
<s> every button every individual button has its one more score suppose the user has pressed a button on button one then it would have is that the circuit will generate a specific morse code to put that that button </s>
<s> and the transistor will amplify the signal and send them to the l. e. d. </s>
<s> which translates the signal into infrared light they get and you have got a signal by pressing the button that uh that uh morse code has been generated by the integrated so cute now that signal that most code has to be amplified by the transistor that is the use of transistor transistor be which we use in the remote control it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the e. d. and which translates the signal into an infrared infrared bits </s>
<s> the sensor and the t_v can see the infrared light and seeing the signal </s>
<s> seeing the signal read it react appropriately that when it sees the amplified have more morse code signal and that it will uh it will uh will know which what what action it has to do then it will do the appropriate action </s>
<s> so uh this is how the </s>
<s> remote controller works </s>
<s> can you put it next to us </s>
<s> yeah i have fewer pictures when you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's it this is a normal remote controller </s>
<s> uh and and to an extent these </s>
<s> and they'll be harder than the few buttons and all and and if you open the remote controller you have this secular the circuit board and few electronic components like you can see a chip then which is having eighteen bins and also up capacitor a capacitor three sisters and also resonator uh um </s>
<s> mm yeah </s>
<s> and that and a diode transistor </s>
<s> the electronic components are all of the electronic components half all those things take the chip and </s>
<s> and they won't </s>
<s> transistors and </s>
<s> yeah the um can you you can see the d. a. w. one eight three five limited uh chip yes um </s>
<s> uh you can also see the logo the clicking completing things are uh these at the at the other sisters and just beside that you can see a transistor and the the uh cylinder shape uh that one is the capacitor </s>
<s> uh and also they are uh </s>
<s> my resistance sorry </s>
<s> the that is that i won't </s>
<s> um can you would want to ask </s>
<s> so uh this is the circuit board the green one is a circuit board </s>
<s> actually a building that's a people board is pretty pretty easy and also it set itself to inexpensive it's it costs less than what you print on a people because they'll blow when you're when you're building there are some </s>
<s> so if you want some uh data set yields and also via it's it's better to go for printing because it you can build up these kind of circuit boards on the on a book and it's just printing nothing like you know you don't need to use wires and all it's not exactly why as we are using it's just printing something on a board </s>
<s> that door those planes will act act as wires and set up so it keeps </s>
<s> so that that green oh thing is a circuit board and also you can see uh they don has like oh um can access what buttons make it when you press a button there so cute and then the button will be activated it will it will head and get some signals from eight </s>
<s> and it will uh it will achieve its to say send the signal signals to the yeah um integrated circuit </s>
<s> good good looks like it </s>
<s> uh so this is these are the set you sell on underneath the buttons </s>
<s> uh can you see the black car problem amongst the the other symptoms </s>
<s> text books </s>
<s> and um </s>
<s> like i hope we have i designed it before we have seen some uh few things like um instead of buttons we have some schools </s>
<s> uh but i have a push-button requires a simple chip underneath that but we'll has a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range maker school pros we have to go for that </s>
<s> sophisticated and </s>
<s> okay i'll i'll </s>
<s> go through a complete ship </s>
<s> uh and uh as energy source we offer a basic battery </s>
<s> um or ingenious a high dynamo </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> a kind of provision of energy more than what is that usually gadgety to provide energy so would that also be can have enough battery um or we can use solar cells </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> center's </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> uh yeah the product can be uh delivered into different cases uh usually the keys this and card flat so that we've we see usually uh uh on normal remote controller </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> okay yeah and you have more pictures um we have five minutes to the end of any of the other i have just one more slide open </s>
<s> so um </s>
<s> like we can have well-made material such as plastic rubber wood titanium or titanium began to use </s>
<s> um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular uh um with the uh order an advanced chip on print </s>
<s> um also info it includes the infrared sender sender </s>
<s> um yeah and for the movie distance to develop a sample sensor speaker </s>
<s> sample speaker </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> uh it's it </s>
<s> it's phone </s>
<s> i'm okay i think you'll </s>
<s> any particular comments by anybody </s>
<s> uh on the scroll wheel push-button </s>
<s> um could you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button </s>
<s> no the the the the scrolling was a different like you can go first switch is like buttons or scrolls uh-huh uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before i think now </s>
<s> nobody uses it because you need you need about god </s>
<s> sophisticated chip and also lighting it's what do we go for uh in ordinary buttons would discover bleep buttons version look on his wrist across yeah </s>
<s> okay we don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her </s>
<s> okay uh i think my first my next slide </s>
<s> no not okay </s>
<s> um ah my method that is um i'm interested in what competition is doing </s>
<s> and that wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition so i've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for the remote controllers </s>
<s> i see i spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing </s>
<s> and then one i'm out um in people's houses or meetings or anything like that </s>
<s> i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have </s>
<s> and if it's can be in the conversation i ask about it and i would encourage you all to the same </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and my findings from this is that </s>
<s> you know small is beautiful </s>
<s> um people like something that really fits in their hand </s>
<s> simple is beautiful they don't want to have to square at small print um in what buttons in those functions are obvious </s>
<s> and they want um as few buttons as possible and they don't care for the mode thing they want each button to do something that eye-catching is important it's gotta look here it's gotta look appealing grad and trying to finish fast way </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and our preferences as far as i'm concerned we gotta get to the market before the competition ours has to be </s>
<s> looked really great and it has to come out before the others that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out there christmas i don't </s>
<s> and we should develop one or two features we can really do well on in our ad campaign if we try to sell people it has too many great features </s>
<s> um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get any worse you've gotta narrow our selection down to </s>
<s> pardon </s>
<s> two things i think that would give us a are really great about our our our new product </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> i will look around um at what designs every year different things are popular in in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular </s>
<s> and people are tired of hard plastic in hard metal there are more back into soft feel spongy feeling things things with maybe a little cloth on um so those are things we wanna look at as far as sale ability of the item </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> that </s>
<s> concludes the presentation of everyone </s>
<s> and what we really have is deciding this </s>
<s> meeting </s>
<s> he's </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> the concept of the remote </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and uh </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> so what do we think </s>
<s> on the concept </s>
<s> austin looked </s>
<s> in my throat come back to you as the movie any is ever likely include this feature discard this voice recognizer yeah okay </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> so speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned this could be uh one feature which could be said </s>
<s> yeah the recognizer can </s>
<s> star feature that there won't be a really good idea in my brother but i'm already pretty much doubtful how how </s>
<s> uh find it will work </s>
<s> because a speech recognizer likelihood </s>
<s> hasn't </s>
<s> 's one now uh </s>
<s> this is close </s>
<s> yeah it's not distance problem it it's recognizing the person's ones like maybe different people will be having different voices so uh like it didn't </s>
<s> every well you you teach you have to teach i don't could recognize recognizing system that is being added in like you regarding uh about order uh um of creation or maybe </s>
<s> and then you are expecting an answer from for example you have a t_v system and they use up h_m_m family members other you said i would already have a cord yeah but uh in a question like </s>
<s> uh put money maker on a program on to see the news in the television so i would say it is good morning and the dealer's switch on my to recognize my voice </s>
<s> yeah that's right right before we get too far off here um the components of the concept is the energy </s>
<s> what kind of energy do we </s>
<s> for c. </s>
<s> battery i think battery battery and i think we all agreed on that that that's that's gonna be most cost effective and the best thing </s>
<s> okay and then chip on print too yeah well it's </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> and the case and i think we all agree on the case we wanna have something either maybe bright color fall yeah </s>
<s> i'm broke over four noise was trying to do this already this is wrong </s>
<s> right ma'am </s>
<s> then it is eyeing compact and stronger moves </s>
<s> user interface concept </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> interface type supplements </s>
<s> that would be your area i think right </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> like this which is like we use buttons for user interface push-buttons like push-buttons i guess so for her yeah </s>
<s> uh don't </s>
<s> not sure what i mean by supplements so when i say different types of features but then it's </s>
<s> yellow light but rather cursory home you should also be visible on speech recognition right right maximum yes </s>
<s> but this one we put down speech recognition if possible endings more research from our industrial engineer and how expensive that is right it's </s>
<s> uh okay uh </s>
<s> our next meeting will be in thirty minutes and it in the </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> i he </s>
<s> is to is is the individual actions to be taken until then </s>
<s> to have the look-and-feel design </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> uh the u. i. t. is supposed to </s>
<s> uh come up with the user interface design </s>
<s> um and the marketing expert with the product evaluation um in this phase the two of you we are now in the francine have to work together on a prototype using modeling clay </s>
<s> it says here </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> and you will receive specific </s>
<s> yeah instructions </s>
<s> will be sent to you by your coaches working </s>
<s> um if you have any questions you know you'll you can always uh contact me </s>
<s> um or uh or your coach i suppose </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> in hiding </s>
<s> three hundred other than that it's </s>
<s> so um i think we conclude the meeting here and we come back here and uh </s>
<s> uh thirty minutes yeah according to our timetable </s>
<s> thank you ever thank you </s>
<s> apple's </s>
<s> kick boxing or </s>
<s> smack </s>
<s> it is </s>
<s> i'm </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> okay okay so </s>
<s> one of the largest character </s>
<s> yeah i think about that </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> but </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> well hi everyone again </s>
<s> oh we've </s>
<s> go there </s>
<s> uh i'm and </s>
<s> like before we uh </s>
<s> i have to read user meetings from ten minutes from the last meeting and when we yeah so </s>
<s> here we go </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was open by the presentation </s>
<s> from the interface uh um </s>
<s> designer </s>
<s> and that the </s>
<s> look 's would be very important </s>
<s> on this new remote </s>
<s> and uh </s>
<s> is to send messages of course to the t_v </s>
<s> it should have nine channel buttons and next but then volume buttons subtitle buttons </s>
<s> switch to control features color contrast truck let's etcetera </s>
<s> different memories which you would but in your case the telephone rings or something </s>
<s> uh he's </s>
<s> speech recognition is one of her very for it favorite personal uh uh feature she would like see to do it to to be integrated in this um </s>
<s> in this new remote </s>
<s> uh um </s>
<s> should be child-friendly design with few buttons colorful may t_vs star shaped or other shape buttons </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> she uh </s>
<s> presented also an oversized remote </s>
<s> uh which </s>
<s> she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> uh challenged on my point but </s>
<s> but uh </s>
<s> a very for a personal favorite really she she would very much like to see a speech recognizer </s>
<s> integrated in this remote </s>
<s> industrial designer </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> resented her </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> the thoughts on the issue </s>
<s> she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong </s>
<s> not using any harmful materials </s>
<s> should be recycle both </s>
<s> and there should be colorful </s>
<s> should have an integrated circuit board to that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant </s>
<s> she would like to see a timer </s>
<s> and the war all our </s>
<s> facility </s>
<s> integrated </s>
<s> yeah uh technically this thing would also have a sister and incapacitated or </s>
<s> a diode transistor </s>
<s> resonator </s>
<s> and you possibly rechargeable battery </s>
<s> uh and of course the circuit board </s>
<s> and how it would works you press the button the chip </s>
<s> is a morse morse code related </s>
<s> relays the uh to the </s>
<s> generally </s>
<s> it it </s>
<s> generator amplification </s>
<s> and uh </s>
<s> this you could </s>
<s> board is very inexpensive to build </s>
<s> and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider </s>
<s> she would like uh </s>
<s> this whole thing should be push-buttons with a simple chip </s>
<s> the scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore </s>
<s> should be battery operated 's </s>
<s> and of course should have the special cases </s>
<s> the marketing expert </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> who has to find a come up </s>
<s> with to to to market this product </s>
<s> has been watching the competition </s>
<s> has done some research on the internet </s>
<s> and also </s>
<s> has used for for personal observations to come out </s>
<s> with the fact that </s>
<s> dad's </s>
<s> such a remote so it should be small </s>
<s> easy to use </s>
<s> and it should be eye-catching </s>
<s> from our point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get the market before our competition does </s>
<s> to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could well on or you know the words on which our campaign </s>
<s> could be built on </s>
<s> too many new features are too many points would only confuse matter </s>
<s> so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh </s>
<s> different home </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> it should have a fruit and vegetable design </s>
<s> and should have a soft feel she feels that's really what people want to die </s>
<s> and the decision that we took last time it was that uh uh </s>
<s> the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer </s>
<s> the energy should be battery </s>
<s> uh should be on a chip </s>
<s> should be trendy design compact and strong </s>
<s> and should have buttons </s>
<s> and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting </s>
<s> now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype </s>
<s> yeah yeah </s>
<s> because they look like that but okay </s>
<s> uh so this is our what uh we have to me that this is a model of the remote control which we are going to be </s>
<s> uh the since us in a snail shape </s>
<s> we've </s>
<s> so uh it it is attractive </s>
<s> um and it's it's a blue yeah </s>
<s> hello </s>
<s> uh right </s>
<s> and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different kind of buttons </s>
<s> still it does out uh i look wise it does beautiful and uh and also compact in shape to uh to </s>
<s> and also it it will be easy if it didn't it into the hands and then you can access all the buttons easily </s>
<s> oh don't good </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> 's </s>
<s> but </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> used to have all the buttons </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> and uh </s>
<s> and the material which we are going to use for the keys 's out plastic </s>
<s> and i know which is which is a strong </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and also offer the </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> the material is plastic and um for the buttons that there's a soft rubber </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> and that's going yeah that's a separate yeah because uh you'd be touching the buttons more solid as a soft menu comes in and then um </s>
<s> oh for the for the land for the light emitting diode it doesn't fluorescent green </s>
<s> and and so uh </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> it is not fun like uh </s>
<s> non-native </s>
<s> instrument </s>
<s> and the button buttons but uh will be explained in fast enough that okay </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> we decided upon including setting features and adhere more to add these features includes uh it's uh um signal emitting a signal it's them in a yellow immunity to um infrared there </s>
<s> note that i have included the switch on and off back then </s>
<s> we'll </s>
<s> now we have included that the feature that is the mute button </s>
<s> and who've </s>
<s> and the sight of </s>
<s> marty </s>
<s> um who didn't get included </s>
<s> why don't nine back times </s>
<s> for controlling the program it's the different channels </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> we have also included too but didn't 's for increasing or decreasing the boarding </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program genders </s>
<s> not ordered uh module also contains a back then we just got is the middle but that what kind of button menu method menu menu in the main one one at the center </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> we have included a backpack with just fluorescent green card then and this is the menu that didn't which will control the color sharpness brightness </s>
<s> them </s>
<s> of the screen updated that the chip </s>
<s> they are also included but didn't </s>
<s> we just got as the slapping back then </s>
<s> no this is uh a special special feature which we have included at this but then </s>
<s> it's and i don gave it </s>
<s> shaped but it and this is slightly flexible </s>
<s> so if it gets down towards that light </s>
<s> it will take to the previous channel if it gets turned towards that like ipod paper that makes gender </s>
<s> i think they are set to the previous and next gen so this is a </s>
<s> slapping battery </s>
<s> the next channel you know anywhere </s>
<s> better for uh no strapping as if if for example you are you are watching the second channel that um and then you go to the dates janet and you have to go back to the second generally gets back </s>
<s> there's but that that okay it's okay </s>
<s> and at the end it this more test in there twice recognizer </s>
<s> which in which will take an extra uses voice </s>
<s> um and then if the act accordingly </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> so this is a proposed market wouldn't now the marketing expert has to </s>
<s> television </s>
<s> i think he'll </s>
<s> hesitation or it could be celebrated but not particularly guys effect on her </s>
<s> okay well um </s>
<s> one one i really like </s>
<s> a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing of one thousand yes yeah it's can maybe hold it in one it you will need two hands and it easily reachable looking for something small yeah </s>
<s> yes the buttons are all raised right </s>
<s> but it always and if you hold it in the center very and you can even reach it over here right </s>
<s> so you don't have to turn it around and turn it upside down to her hands and open ended up and down i really like that you really did a good job on that </s>
<s> when we've designer's </s>
<s> but </s>
<s> he's um </s>
<s> uh um </s>
<s> um i like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place that's that's a really good </s>
<s> yes and it sort of sticks up so hadn't been really </s>
<s> you don't have to go first go like oh yeah you read on it and it's yeah the colors very attractive </s>
<s> um the um </s>
<s> these buttons uh around here are very here too </s>
<s> no these the front buttons is down here in that the mute buttons </s>
<s> on both sides yes yes so you can push either one yes okay so if you're left-handed are right handed in this phase the menu up on the screen </s>
<s> but this brings the million dollars yes yes the orange ones </s>
<s> ah </s>
<s> and the the these these two i do think either the keys or what goods </s>
<s> oh okay </s>
<s> and these two add to uh scroll the program check and it's sort of yeah </s>
<s> restaurant that was go down the chain uh looks down </s>
<s> looks like something like itself </s>
<s> in the u_k um no i suppose um i have one question </s>
<s> uh will there be anything with non the buttons like that people know what they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what has it been have uh these patterns will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons when it has some that's will have symbols that design we think either you don't really know is you know it doesn't have to first order because we need </s>
<s> symbols 'cause we're going into the international market we can have anything with one yes dependent but anyway what i it it has to have some kind of all simple examples text or something like that i can have on the keys itself and that's right and imprinted on the keys of tables i just wanna make sure that and manual feature is speak we have a water for this mode which is and i stay shape </s>
<s> i shared shape for the snow right in the movies has no shown ask me he goes right back into his lungs right well you know i think we could do something really funny with this theory because the snail is going to be slow um </s>
<s> uh we could have some sort of little </s>
<s> comic a factor on their marketing about how this is the rapid snail is the right yeah and that would really work </s>
<s> that was a one hour special features for the marketing that's really the voice recognition that's really on utilizing we'll voice recognition is our big selling point is nobody else seems to have uh in in this price range and then and then the other thing would </s>
<s> basically be cheese shape </s>
<s> or </s>
<s> practicality of use </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> uh well i think that </s>
<s> everybody is gonna say their remote control is practical </s>
<s> i think we have color too we have to dwell on on on the appearance </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> you really gonna have </s>
<s> the best third </s>
<s> she chooses to remote control on the block so i think we have to play with the image play with the snail image </s>
<s> um play with the visual </s>
<s> and then the voice recognition i think those are the two things to push the lock </s>
<s> and the voice recognition there are gonna be are two selling points </s>
<s> uh okay now uh having said that i'm supposed to make room for </s>
<s> yeah sure </s>
<s> well now and now this was that evaluation criteria which you know him and just have done </s>
<s> now we don't it </s>
<s> talk a bad financing </s>
<s> ah </s>
<s> any more instructions i think it's always possible </s>
<s> to important um </s>
<s> um isn't </s>
<s> what is the production evaluation is that you </s>
<s> yes me </s>
<s> but that's after financing oh okay these are not easy some are you </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> hm hm </s>
<s> uh um </s>
<s> okay we had it looks and voice recognition </s>
<s> okay now on the financing we bring up the um </s>
<s> me that's </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> energy source we say that it's </s>
<s> battery right </s>
<s> right </s>
<s> oh okay </s>
<s> ma'am </s>
<s> so we'd </s>
<s> i guess we use one </s>
<s> yeah yes </s>
<s> so electronic </s>
<s> we'll </s>
<s> to </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> oh that's nice </s>
<s> if something could just change between them </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> 'kay just fill in the boxes </s>
<s> uh how can yeah </s>
<s> i see </s>
<s> okay won </s>
<s> uh okay and </s>
<s> oh yeah </s>
<s> uh 'em kinetic solar so that in the energy source that's all we need </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> uh electronic simple chip on print is that'll be using one of those </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> okay won </s>
<s> uh regular chip on print no </s>
<s> no that's all we need the one </s>
<s> case uncurved flat </s>
<s> it single curved double curved </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> since not single </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> or does it still work or </s>
<s> double curved </s>
<s> one of those </s>
<s> case material supplements plastic </s>
<s> present right </s>
<s> uh wood rubber </s>
<s> rubber because we have the soft buttons </s>
<s> uh but yes but </s>
<s> i think uh that is uh </s>
<s> for for that that is just for the case material so there is a special color so we having that right </s>
<s> um isn't </s>
<s> and then we have the interface push-buttons </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> scroll wheel no integrated scroll wheel </s>
<s> l. c. display </s>
<s> you're um </s>
<s> but we didn't put the clock in it after all </s>
<s> no </s>
<s> uh button supplement special color </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> special for </s>
<s> yes yes you do have special </s>
<s> 'kay </s>
<s> and special material rubber wood yes </s>
<s> oh okay </s>
<s> total seven point six whatever that means </s>
<s> i think that's </s>
<s> that's the price you </s>
<s> um because it's </s>
<s> eight </s>
<s> eight eight </s>
<s> point two </s>
<s> yeah that's nice um </s>
<s> a pointer right </s>
<s> so we looks like we are </s>
<s> well within budget movement 'kay </s>
<s> um okay </s>
<s> i should say it seems to function </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yes </s>
<s> i just tried yeah </s>
<s> nine document document </s>
<s> i mentioned i i yes yes </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> fine </s>
<s> okay good so that's the good news </s>
<s> you're gonna be popular </s>
<s> hello </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> uh um </s>
<s> so that uh i think financing was </s>
<s> pretty simple uh-huh </s>
<s> now we would like </s>
<s> to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation </s>
<s> can help that </s>
<s> my file mails you know </s>
<s> 'kay should grammar </s>
<s> and you will just the next slide and all right </s>
<s> the over the next slide yeah </s>
<s> we okay well </s>
<s> uh obviously my method for uh </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> the the marketing of this thing is first as the big question will itself </s>
<s> uh i think we should show this prototype </s>
<s> two people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we haven't thought of we can't accept every suggestion of course but maybe we just need to get a few </s>
<s> and show the the prototype you can see research groups will not want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us </s>
<s> that this button is toxic um you know some charles wobble and then we would sell anything so we have to get some input from most people </s>
<s> and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> yeah we like it we think it's good </s>
<s> we can get behind it and sell it </s>
<s> um next slide please </s>
<s> okay </s>
<s> yeah of the things that i was thinking and look at my wish list is really really honest in this prototype </s>
<s> i wanted the shape to be biomorphic i didn't want anything with angles and all square one to be comfy and brownies and we got that size a small the colors brighter and more which is what we wanted </s>
<s> when it feel to be as soft as possible will have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped even though it's gonna be hard plastic it feels good in your hand so that size </s>
<s> and functionality output where stylus because people are gonna use it to what they buy </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> paradoxically the other feature is in other words the look the feel um and the shape yeah that's what people are gonna get in the store and they don't have a television store that you play with it um so they'll be a man selling points so um </s>
<s> that have also been fulfilled by your prototype </s>
<s> and go ahead to the next slide please </s>
<s> okay so um </s>
<s> the shape </s>
<s> um i think </s>
<s> is a a one of its really really excellent shape </s>
<s> the size is small </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> and that these points are in the importance for the for the marketing these are in how i feel </s>
<s> i think that it's i think that is plenty small enough to sell but i think we're sort of right the scales one to seven i think we're sort of right in the middle as far as like other competitors </s>
<s> and our color i think it's great colors are bright and one really do a great job there </s>
<s> and given um the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible </s>
<s> and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality obviously we could have added </s>
<s> added different functions but then we just or something else so i would say that we got two or five out of seven go on functionality so i think that basically got a great product and we can go off and running with it </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> i just realized one thing yes in the financing there was no room for our voice recognizer </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> and uh i don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that </s>
<s> well </s>
<s> um we had what eight eight euros twenty as a call h. a. twenty yes the answer got it was about four euros to go see this band i mean maximum we have another four point three dollars i mean uh four thirty no um </s>
<s> the last </s>
<s> i mean we have no way of presenting that to management </s>
<s> as you know as if </s>
<s> finished as a finished product and saying okay we several ways recognizer that costs so much um </s>
<s> so um we just have to </s>
<s> be aware of that um in and you know whether there for thirty will really cover that </s>
<s> well as we know in today's technical technological world you can do just about anything at any price of it but the problem is quality so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us </s>
<s> uh and um it may not be the greatest quality but may sell it anyway </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> as we see with so many of these come in </s>
<s> okay i'm sorry to interrupt but i just uh break it uh i just remember that there was no um </s>
<s> that that was not um included in uh that there was no room for any special features um okay </s>
<s> so that would be the error that </s>
<s> you wanna 'cause next slide marketing expert </s>
<s> well i i it's in this my last slide i dunno </s>
<s> can't </s>
<s> yes it was well muscled um </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> um i'm supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard </s>
<s> um and we're supposed to talk about those things team now so if you put my last slide back up there </s>
<s> hello </s>
<s> i'm sorry uh </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> wow </s>
<s> i kinda </s>
<s> hm </s>
<s> well because </s>
<s> i </s>
<s> can't remember one for long </s>
<s> i think my </s>
<s> okay uh sources you have online wishes here </s>
<s> i think you can make it there didn't </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> yeah we're all supposed to say well they've </s>
<s> um we've </s>
<s> 'kay and so </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> sorry </s>
<s> hi carolina </s>
<s> they want you there are like one being here and seven being the worst section </s>
<s> um well you can shake those </s>
<s> yeah won't okay </s>
<s> haven't but </s>
<s> that's it yes i think uh shape is one yeah okay uh huh yeah she missing </s>
<s> correct </s>
<s> then how 'bout </s>
<s> uh size </s>
<s> oh and so are you you live either full or or what i feel is just the average </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> i think that would give it at least a two </s>
<s> so i okay </s>
<s> okay man </s>
<s> and even i think that that's one </s>
<s> weights more </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> for anything you desire with it </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> yeah i thought they ended up battery on color </s>
<s> color uh either i i gave it a while i really like all as far as per why i like the colors one one one </s>
<s> yeah and weren't </s>
<s> i i i okay </s>
<s> uh how wealthy </s>
<s> making and uh um </s>
<s> 'cause variation texture </s>
<s> and capturing the united </s>
<s> uh i don't give it too </s>
<s> let's </s>
<s> recruited through private three </s>
<s> really </s>
<s> how many 'til </s>
<s> you'll yeah </s>
<s> uh the rest is functionality </s>
<s> where are i admit i was more hard on their king </s>
<s> well it's also you can't really tried out uh uh the other things you have more is a more tangible so </s>
<s> from that point if you but um </s>
<s> uh give us three </s>
<s> okay yeah </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> so </s>
<s> uh three </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> uh okay it </s>
<s> i'll um </s>
<s> what slightly brighter colors or </s>
<s> uh how should our selling price or military </s>
<s> crafty </s>
<s> okay developed </s>
<s> really </s>
<s> i don't really have any logically </s>
<s> yeah don't but </s>
<s> uh uh um </s>
<s> otherwise like we're </s>
<s> go through this </s>
<s> anybody else have any other comments or any other things if you should evaluate </s>
<s> uh </s>
<s> here is what we are looking at </s>
<s> uh satisfaction uh for example room for creativity </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy </s>
<s> immediately obvious include these include some more buttons and those features yeah features we can meet the buttons few buttons on the </s>
<s> uh i can be a quite big </s>
<s> so i think that i mean we can we can just have small buttons and more buttons and at least if we want to have </s>
<s> more features than that </s>
<s> well that kind of uh um </s>
<s> do the speech recognition then longer go there can be some buttons that are gonna be at yeah that means the recording of uh speech leaves and so that that's where we're gonna have cheery </s>
<s> do maybe table with a lot of the mute button instead of having to use it in uh in uh in the room </s>
<s> maybe we can do something with the um </s>
<s> the volume control you can put that all on one button </s>
<s> um </s>
<s> uh hum </s>
<s> and </s>
<s> everybody </s>
<s> really </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> consolidate some of the usage and we can see we can go </s>
<s> now i will always be bearing in mind that right now we of course well within the budget and that we still you know </s>
<s> we probably can't </s>
<s> which this particular item we probably can't just uh </s>
<s> and a whole lot of more things uh </s>
<s> um we need uh </s>
<s> you know we need to leave space money wise only for the voice recognizer </s>
<s> uh huh </s>
<s> so that the the question really is how do we feel with the project process uh </s>
<s> uh 'em are we happy with the creativity that has </s>
<s> past euro or are we not happy </s>
<s> with the new product we created all that was created </s>
<s> uh i think personally i think uh i'm pretty happy i'm pretty happy with uh we really i think i could mark it yeah yeah and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project </s>
<s> uh why did you done a good job </s>
<s> but don't uh </s>
<s> uh i think teamwork ling was very very good </s>
<s> yeah well you you you eh you won't work together as a team h_m_m </s>
<s> and uh i think we </s>
<s> are we happy with the means we used to use </s>
<s> whiteboard we can use digital to digital pens i guess all these things so that we could have used the word for a cold war yeah </s>
<s> we won't yes we could uh it's maybe not in the best position in the room </s>
<s> uh maybe you know like sometimes it's decisions so that it's much better reasonable for everybody though and i think from that point if you read so if you can order it a little bit to the user slide because it was better position yes i think so i think absolutely and project maybe all had slide presentation was made a little easier um </s>
<s> uh i'm giving you did we find new ideas i think we did look and remaining were very but i think we we did uh more than one respect or something and uh </s>
<s> so i think lead it very well here </s>
<s> are the costs within budget yes yes uh is the project evaluated that said yes yeah </s>
<s> uh version of the the celebration </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> today we have apple juice and after we sell all newly level we have shape </s>
<s> yeah </s>
<s> so i i thank you all very much um </s>
<s> i think this was very good at ten and uh um </s>
<s> i think we did come up with a new product that uh feasible </s>
<s> visible from the production point if you infeasible form a marketing point if you will </s>
<s> so i okay </s>
<s> thank you </s>
<s> thank you in nice </s>
<s> what i have like working on </s>
<s> i always get on that a little </s>
<s> because we still have to kind of </s>
<s> uh you have one </s>
<s> oh is it five minutes </s>
<s> oh yeah we have time left but we don't remember we were told we could and the final meeting at any time and i am running without we yeah we didn't have to fill in </s>
<s> which </s>
<s> okay yeah </s>
<s> one microphone yeah </s>
<s> remember </s>
<s> oh </s>
<s> cool </s>
<s> yeah there we go </s>
<s> yeah </s>
